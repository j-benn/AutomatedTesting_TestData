            <description type="full">Abstract: This vegetation survey data package comprises standardised vegetation condition measurements, which were first conducted in 2004 and then repeated in 2006, 2007 and 2009 using vegetation structure plots (1 m x 1 m, 20 m x 20 m) nested within 1 ha sites. Within the 100 m x 100 m 1 ha survey site, two 20 m x 20 m plots are located along a central transect at the 20–40 m and 60–80 m points. Within each of the 20 m x 20 m plots are four 1 m x 1 m subplots. Plot data are measured in two 20 m x 20 m plots at each site. Ground cover is measured in four 1 m x 1 m subplots located within each 20 m x 20 m plot. Landscape context variables are measured in polygons of 200 m and 500 m radii around each field site.

Much of Booderee National Park was burned by wildfire in December 2003.

The Jervis Bay Booderee National Park Plot Network was established in 2002 in Booderee National Park in the Jervis Bay Territory, south-eastern Australia. The study location is a floristically diverse area in which fire history has been well-documented over several decades. The plot network’s objectives involve quantifying the inter-relationships between natural disturbance and/or management intervention (including weed and feral animal control and prescribed burning) and the reciprocal changes in vegetation condition and biodiversity response. This particular study forms part of the collection of data packages from the Jervis Bay Booderee National Park Plot Network. 

A synopsis of related data packages which have been collected as part of the Jervis Bay Plot Network’s full program is provided at https://doi.org/10.25911/5c3c070a5ee94.

Sampling method: Since March 2007, surveying has taken place at a total of 130 sites. These include the original 110 permanent sites in the study at Booderee National Park, as first delineated in 2002, using two stratifying variables: (1) broad vegetation type (heathland, forest, woodland, etc.); and (2) past fire history – classified into four classes of time since the last fire (0-10 years, 11-20 years, 21-30 years and &amp;gt;30 years). Also included since March 2007 are 20 extra sites, set up as part of the “Bitou experiment”.

Study extent: Please refer to "Temporal Coverage", "Geographic Coverage", and "Taxonomic Coverage and Classification".

Project funding: Up until 2012 this project was funded by an ARC Linkage Grant and industry partners Parks Australia and the Department of Defence. Between 2012 and 2018 this project was part of, and funded through the Long Term Ecological Research Network (LTERN) a facility within the Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (TERN) and supported by the Australian Government through the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy.

            <description type="brief">In 2003, Geoscience Australia discovered three large patch reefs in the southern Gulf of Carpentaria (GA Survey 238; SS-03/2004; Harris et al., 2004).  The submerged platform reefs (R1, R2 and R3) are located east of Mornington Island and appear to have been formed when sea level was ~30 m below its present position, however as the ship did not come prepared with a drill-core sampler, the sub-surface composition of the reefs was not determined. The submerged platforms support live hard corals in many locations and their discovery raised the question of the possibility of widespread reef occurrence in that region.  Survey 276 was designed to deliver some answers to these questions. 

The current survey used rotary drilling of reefs R1, R2 and R3 which recovered coral material from 8 sites and confirmed the coral reef composition of these features.  Multibeam sonar bathymetry and rotary drill cores were collected over two sections (R4 and R5) of a large (&amp;gt;100 km long) submerged platform that extends westwards from Mornington Island.  The platform exhibits a Karst erosion surface, exhibiting drainage and depressions with raised rims, overprinting relict reef-growth geomorphic features.  Reef growth features include raised rims, spur and groove reef front and elevated back-reef mounds. Other platform reefs were mapped in the south-western Gulf (R6 and R7) and in the Arafura Sea (R8).  Rotary drilling has confirmed the coral reef composition of these features.

Preliminary assessments of the recovered drill cores indicate that reef growth has persisted in the region for several glacial cycles, extending over at least the past 120,000 years.  Dating of Holocene corals by the U/Th method demonstrates that a phase of rapid (1-2 m per kyr) reef growth occurred at most sites between 9 and 7 kyr before present, with zero or much reduced growth rates occurring after 7 kyr ago.  Although coral growth occurs in many areas, the production of carbonate has not been sufficient to build the reef-tops upwards to the present sea level.  The observations of live corals, but low carbonate production rates, are consistent with a 'catch-up' reef growth pattern, in which the upper surfaces of the reefs are submerged 20 to 30 m below present sea level, with isolated local reef-tops having reached to within 18 m of the sea surface.  An analysis of the hypsometry of the reef surfaces indicates that platform surfaces at all sites (R1 to R8) are confined to two narrow depth intervals, centred at 26.8 Â± 1 m and 30.7 Â± 0.3 m.  The good correspondence of hypsometric peaks indicates regionally significant phases of carbonate deposition during a prolonged, Pleistocene sea level still stand.

This voyage has proved that the southern Gulf of Carpentaria contains a previously unknown major coral reef province in Australia.  The reefs support locally diverse and luxuriant coral growth.  From a management perspective, the slow rates of coral growth point to the need for protection of these reef systems because of their limited capacity to recover from natural or human-induced disturbances.</description>

            <description type="lineage">The Vlaming Sub-Basin survey, GA-0334 GP1373 was acquired by Geoscience Australia onboard the RV Southern Supporter from the 17th of March to the 20th of April 2012. 
The GA representative onboard was Mr. George Bernardel.
This dataset was acquired and processed onboard by Fugro and further reprocessing of the data was conducted in the office by Cameron Buchanan and by Michele Spinoccia, using CARIS HIPS &amp; SIPS ver 7.1.2.
The naming of the raw bathymetry data had to be changed to show the date, time and vessel.
Then the timing of the raw and the processed data needed to matched as the raw and processed bathymetry data timing did not match.
Then the navigation for different files/days were missing and needed to be loaded and merged with the rest of the dataset.
1. First a vessel configuration file was created where the co-ordinates of the motion sensor and DGPS antenna and patch test offsets were recorded.
2. A new project was then created and the vessel configuration file was attached to the project file. 
3. The raw swath sonar data, in raw.all format, for each line was then imported into the project and the vessel information assigned to the data.  
4. The motion sensor, DGPS and heading data were then cleaned using a filter that averaged adjacent data to remove artifacts. 
5. Different sound velocity profiles data for each block were attached to the corresponding raw swath sonar data files to correct the depths for changes in the speed of sound through the water column.
6. Then a new blank field area was defined that specified the geographic area of study and the co-ordinate system used. The co-ordinates for the study areas were WGS84 UTM-50S.
7. The data was cleaned by applying several filters that removed any remaining spikes in the bathymetry data using user defined threshold values. A visual inspection of the data for each line was then undertaken where artifacts and noisy data not removed by the filtering process were removed manually using Swath and subset editors modules of the Caris HIPS/SIPS software.
8. All the data for each bathymetric, motion sensor, DGPS, heading, tide and sound velocity profile data were merged to produce the final processed data file. A weighted grid of the processed data was then created for each Block.
In GA the tide was applied to the grid to correct for tidal variations and velocity corrections were performed to correct for different artifacts and mismatches. 
9. The processed data was finally exported as grids soundings or false colored images for presentation and reporting and as final processed data in  in ASCII XYZ  as well as geotif formats of 50m resolution.
10-Using CARIS Base editor 4.0 the grids were exported as ESRI ASCII grid, then imported into ARC catalogue/info to create a raster file for  the entire survey.</description>

            <description type="full">Geoscience Australia undertook a marine survey of the Vlaming Sub-basin in March and April 2012 to provide seabed and shallow geological information to support an assessment of the CO2 storage potential of this sedimentary basin. The survey was undertaken under the Australian Government's National CO2 Infrastructure Plan (NCIP) to help identify sites suitable for the long term storage of CO2 within reasonable distances of major sources of CO2 emissions. The Vlaming Sub-basin is located offshore from Perth, Western Australia, and was previously identified by the Carbon Storage Taskforce (2009) as potentially highly suitable for CO2 storage. The principal aim of the Vlaming Sub-basin marine survey (GA survey number GA334) was to look for evidence of any past or current gas or fluid seepage at the seabed, and to determine whether these features are related to structures (e.g. faults) in the Vlaming Sub-basin that may extend up to the seabed. The survey also mapped seabed habitats and biota in the areas of interest to provide information on communities and biophysical features that may be associated with seepage. This research addresses key questions on the potential for containment of CO2 in the Early Cretaceous Gage Sandstone (the basin's proposed CO2 storage unit) and the regional integrity of the South Perth Shale (the seal unit that overlies the Gage Sandstone). This dataset comprises high resolution backscatter grids.</description>

            <description type="full">Geoscience Australia undertook a marine survey of the Vlaming Sub-basin in March and April 2012 to provide seabed and shallow geological information to support an assessment of the CO2 storage potential of this sedimentary basin. The survey was undertaken under the Australian Government's National CO2 Infrastructure Plan (NCIP) to help identify sites suitable for the long term storage of CO2 within reasonable distances of major sources of CO2 emissions. The Vlaming Sub-basin is located offshore from Perth, Western Australia, and was previously identified by the Carbon Storage Taskforce (2009) as potentially highly suitable for CO2 storage. The principal aim of the Vlaming Sub-basin marine survey (GA survey number GA334) was to look for evidence of any past or current gas or fluid seepage at the seabed, and to determine whether these features are related to structures (e.g. faults) in the Vlaming Sub-basin that may extend up to the seabed. The survey also mapped seabed habitats and biota in the areas of interest to provide information on communities and biophysical features that may be associated with seepage. This research addresses key questions on the potential for containment of CO2 in the Early Cretaceous Gage Sandstone (the basin's proposed CO2 storage unit) and the regional integrity of the South Perth Shale (the seal unit that overlies the Gage Sandstone). This dataset comprises sidescan grids.</description>

            <description type="lineage">Bottom sediments were collected using a Shipel grab. Surface sediments (~0-2 cm) within the grab were spooned into falcon vials and the porewaters were removed by centrifugation. The samples were then frozen for transport to the laboratories at Geoscience Australia where they were freeze-dried, ground in a tungsten carbide mill and decarbonated. The decarbonated powders were sent to Environmental Isotopes Pty Ltd (Sydney) for isotopic analysis by mass spectrometry. Samples were back-corrected to account for the carbonate removal, used carbonate concentrations derived from the bomb method. Error estimates for the C and N isotope values are ±0.15. The carbonate measurements (used to back correct) were better than 1%. 

Thanks to the crew of the RV Southern Supported for help with sample collection and Anita Andrews of Environmental Isotopes Pty Ltd., for the isotopic analyses.</description>

            <description type="full">Geoscience Australia undertook a marine survey of the Vlaming Sub-basin in March and April 2012 to provide seabed and shallow geological information to support an assessment of the CO2 storage potential of this sedimentary basin. The survey was undertaken under the Australian Government's National CO2 Infrastructure Plan (NCIP) to help identify sites suitable for the long term storage of CO2 within reasonable distances of major sources of CO2 emissions. The Vlaming Sub-basin is located offshore from Perth, Western Australia, and was previously identified by the Carbon Storage Taskforce (2009) as potentially highly suitable for CO2 storage. The principal aim of the Vlaming Sub-basin marine survey (GA survey number GA334) was to look for evidence of any past or current gas or fluid seepage at the seabed, and to determine whether these features are related to structures (e.g. faults) in the Vlaming Sub-basin that may extend up to the seabed. The survey also mapped seabed habitats and biota in the areas of interest to provide information on communities and biophysical features that may be associated with seepage. This research addresses key questions on the potential for containment of CO2 in the Early Cretaceous Gage Sandstone (the basin's proposed CO2 storage unit) and the regional integrity of the South Perth Shale (the seal unit that overlies the Gage Sandstone). This dataset comprises bulk organic carbon and nitrogen isotopes and concentrations from seabed sediments (0-2 cm).</description>

            <description type="lineage">Bottom sediments were collected using a Smith McIntyre grab. 0.4 ml samples of surface sediment (0-0.5 cm) were syringed into plastic bags. The samples were wrapped in Al foil and frozen. Chlorophyll concentrations were calculated on sediment extracts (90% acetone + 0.1% MgCO3) at spectrophometric readings at wavelengths of 647, 630, 750 and 664 nm. For chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and phaeophytin-a, wavelengths of 664 nm and 750 nm (before and after the addition of 200 -L-1 0.1 mol L-1 HCl per 2 mL extractant) and the equation derived by Lorenzen (1967) were used. Chlorphyll b and c concentrations were calculated according to equations provided by Jeffrey and Welschmeyer (2003). Chloroplastic equivalents were estimated from the sum of the chlorophylls and pheophytin a. The attribute accuaracy is +/-10%.

            <description type="lineage">Bottom sediments were collected using a Shipek grab. The surface sediments (~0-2 cm) within the grab were spooned into falcon vials and the porewaters were removed by centrifugation. Bulk carbonate was determined using the carbonate bomb method. Specific surface areas (SSA) were determined using a 5-point Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) adsorption isotherm on a Quantachrome NOVA 2200e analyser, with nitrogen used as the adsorbate. The samples were first cleaned of organic matter by slow heating for 12 hours to 350oC. The %RSD of the SSA replicates was &amp;lt;1%. %RSD of the carbonate method is also ~1%.

Thanks to the crew of the RV Southern Supporter for help with sample collection.</description>

            <description type="full">Geoscience Australia undertook a marine survey of the Vlaming Sub-basin in March and April 2012 to provide seabed and shallow geological information to support an assessment of the CO2 storage potential of this sedimentary basin. The survey was undertaken under the Australian Government's National CO2 Infrastructure Plan (NCIP) to help identify sites suitable for the long term storage of CO2 within reasonable distances of major sources of CO2 emissions. The Vlaming Sub-basin is located offshore from Perth, Western Australia, and was previously identified by the Carbon Storage Taskforce (2009) as potentially highly suitable for CO2 storage. The principal aim of the Vlaming Sub-basin marine survey (GA survey number GA334) was to look for evidence of any past or current gas or fluid seepage at the seabed, and to determine whether these features are related to structures (e.g. faults) in the Vlaming Sub-basin that may extend up to the seabed. The survey also mapped seabed habitats and biota in the areas of interest to provide information on communities and biophysical features that may be associated with seepage. This research addresses key questions on the potential for containment of CO2 in the Early Cretaceous Gage Sandstone (the basin's proposed CO2 storage unit) and the regional integrity of the South Perth Shale (the seal unit that overlies the Gage Sandstone). This dataset comprises %carbonate and specific surface area of seabed sediments.</description>

            <description type="full">We evaluate the status of shellfish reef ecosystems in Australia including their historical distribution and loss, regulation and management and identify current research priorities, policies and conservation mechanisms that can enable their future protection and repair. Eight species of shellfish were identified as developing complex, three-dimensional reef systems over large scales in intertidal and subtidal areas across tropical, subtropical and temperate Australia. A dramatic decline in the extent and condition of Australia’s shellfish reef ecosystems occurred during the mid-1800s to early 1900s in concurrence with extensive harvesting for food and lime production, habitat modification, disease outbreaks and a decline in water quality. Despite early attempts during the late 1800s to curb over exploitation and repair degraded reefs through protection, primitive aquaculture and enhancement, living examples of shellfish reefs are now rare. Only one Ostrea angasi reef is known to exist that is comparable in size to reefs historically commercially fished, compared to at least 118 previously known locations. Out of the 60 historically fished locations identified for Saccostrea glomerata, only five are known to still contain commercially harvestable sized reefs. The introduced oyster Crasostrea gigas is increasing in reef extent, whilst data on the remaining five reef-building species is limited, preventing a detailed assessment of their current status. Our knowledge of the extent, physical characteristics, biodiversity and ecosystem services of natural shellfish reefs in Australia is extremely limited. Australia is well equipped to reverse the decline of shellfish reef ecosystems with a number of state and federal protection laws, international conventions and management mechanisms already in place, all of which can be used to help protect remaining reefs and aid in future recovery. Several restoration projects have recently begun as awareness of historical loss grows amongst the community and groups become motivated to implement repair. As momentum continues to grow, Australia could serve as a long-term model for other regions that may currently have limited understanding of their shellfish reefs ecosystems but wish to work towards their future conservation. Data to be made publicly available with publication of manuscript by end 2018.</description>
            <description type="lineage">Identifying shellfish reef species
In light of the limited published information for reef-building species in Australia, we used a process of expert elicitation through members of the Australian Shellfish Reef Restoration Network (http://www.shellfishrestoration.org.au) to evaluate whether candidate bivalve species should be considered reef building in an Australian context. We evaluated species against predefined criteria: 1) that reefs were made from bivalves living in high densities and which form clearly definable, three-dimensional structures with either high or low vertical profiles 2) contain unique reef attributes such as shell accretion, increased hard surface availability and provision of food and habitats for other species and 3) form reefs at multiple locations throughout their normal distribution. We limited our review to those species that formed primary biogenic habitat on soft sediments and rocky areas rather than those which may form dense aggregations only on rocks, plants or animals. 

We acknowledge that a number of shellfish species not included in our review can develop reef-like systems or dense aggregations but we excluded these because they generally only occur under unique conditions (such as in the reverse estuary gulf systems of South Australia, see Discussion). Species that predominantly reside in sediments (endobenthic), such as Mesodesmatidae (surf clams), Cardiidae (cockles) and Donacidae (pipis) and some species of mussels (e.g. Limnoperna pulex, Xenostrobus inconstans) were excluded from the analysis, as were bivalve species that do not form aggregations dense enough to be considered reef-forming throughout their distribution (e.g. Pinna bicolour). 

Knowledge review: Indigenous and colonial use, historical harvest and regulation, past extent and current distributions
In 2015, The Australian National Environmental Science Programme supported a series of expert workshops and regionally focused reports which aimed to summarise Indigenous and early colonial use of shellfish reefs, historical harvest and regulation, past extent and current distributions and current or planned shellfish reef restoration projects [report findings summarised in 35]. We used this research as the basis of our review and identified further evidence through: 1) a systematic review of primary and secondary data sources likely to have information related to the nominated reef-building species 2) an appraisal of available oyster harvest records and newspaper accounts, 3) identification of historical or current shellfish aquaculture sites and 4) identification of localities where names are related to oysters and mussels (e.g. Oyster Harbour, Limeburners Bay). Methods undertaken to conduct 1-4 above are described below:

To conduct the systematic review,  we identified published journal articles for all nominated reef-forming species using Scopus (https://www.scopus.com/) supplemented by Google Scholar (https://scholar.google.com/). The search terms: ‘Australia’, ‘oyster’, ‘mussel’ and each of the species names listed in Table 1 were used to build a bibliography of all papers published up until to March 2016 (Table S1). We reviewed the primary objectives and results of each paper and categorised them according to several, non-discrete groups related to shellfish reef ecology, aquaculture or both. 

We considered early explorer accounts from 1770 and historical fisheries records maintained by state government fishery agencies from ~1850 to October 2015 for all coastal states (excluding the Northern Territory). We also searched historical newspaper articles for references to oyster fishing, harvesting, and/or dredging from 1800 to 1950 using the online database Trove - a national online catalogue of over 124 million newspaper articles maintained by the National Library of Australia (http://trove.nla.gov.au). We searched for locality names containing oyster*, Mussel* or Limeburner* using the online database Gazetteer of Australian Place Name Search (www.ga.gov.au) and obtained data on shellfish aquaculture locations from relevant state government agencies. 

To determine the past extent of shellfish reefs we followed the methods of Kirby [7], Zu Ermgassen et al. [13] and Alleway and Connell [37], where in the absence of quantitative data on shellfish density (e.g. commercial harvest records or ecological surveys), we applied a threshold approach as a proxy for shellfish reef extent, using the presence of commercial shellfish harvesting which occurred prior to 1950 as an indication of where oysters and mussels occurred in high densities (constituting a minimum harvestable threshold) and which likely formed reefs. We attributed historical commercial fishing to a location if a primary or secondary source was able to provide a description of: (1) commercial harvesting occurring at a specified location, (2) method of extraction (e.g. hand harvest, oyster dredge) and, where possible, (3) the amount of extraction (e.g. bags, bushels, number of oysters, tonnes). 

We used the presence of modern shellfish aquaculture as a second line of evidence for historical reef distribution, since historical accounts often described the development of shellfish aquaculture in the same locations as historical harvesting [35 and refs there in, 43, 44]. We used locality names of ‘Oyster*’ (e.g. Oyster Harbour) Mussel* and ‘Limeburner*’ (e.g. Limeburner’s Bay) as a third line of evidence to identify estuaries where shellfish abundance was clearly a historical distinguishing feature of the estuary or as further evidence that commercial fishing occurred in close proximity (e.g. oyster shells were burnt in kilns to make lime used in building materials- hence ‘Limeburners’). We attribute a locality name to a species only when a single reef-building species occurred for that location (i.e. O. angasi in southern Western Australia, South Australia, Victoria or Tasmania). Where multiple species occurred in a single location (i.e. S. glomerata, O. angasi in New South Wales, we assumed the locality was named after the species primarily harvested and sold at market (S. glomerata for New South Wales).

Not all states had comparable levels of data, for instance, early government fisheries records and maps from New South Wales are largely absent prior to September 1882, due to a fire at the Garden Palace Library in Sydney destroying all historical records. The current locations of O. angasi and S. glomerata reefs were identified by expert elicitation [35] because shellfish reef habitats are not currently classified or recorded in state or federal government habitat mapping databases. Existing reefs were identified if they were of comparable size to historic reefs (i.e. they were large enough to be considered as ‘commercially harvestable’ by small operators, nominally &amp;gt; 1 ha in size).</description>

            <description type="full">We evaluate the status of shellfish reef ecosystems in Australia including their historical distribution and loss, regulation and management and identify current research priorities, policies and conservation mechanisms that can enable their future protection and repair. Eight species of shellfish were identified as developing complex, three-dimensional reef systems over large scales in intertidal and subtidal areas across tropical, subtropical and temperate Australia. A dramatic decline in the extent and condition of Australia’s shellfish reef ecosystems occurred during the mid-1800s to early 1900s in concurrence with extensive harvesting for food and lime production, habitat modification, disease outbreaks and a decline in water quality. Despite early attempts during the late 1800s to curb over exploitation and repair degraded reefs through protection, primitive aquaculture and enhancement, living examples of shellfish reefs are now rare. Only one Ostrea angasi reef is known to exist that is comparable in size to reefs historically commercially fished, compared to at least 118 previously known locations. Out of the 60 historically fished locations identified for Saccostrea glomerata, only five are known to still contain commercially harvestable sized reefs. The introduced oyster Crasostrea gigas is increasing in reef extent, whilst data on the remaining five reef-building species is limited, preventing a detailed assessment of their current status. Our knowledge of the extent, physical characteristics, biodiversity and ecosystem services of natural shellfish reefs in Australia is extremely limited. Australia is well equipped to reverse the decline of shellfish reef ecosystems with a number of state and federal protection laws, international conventions and management mechanisms already in place, all of which can be used to help protect remaining reefs and aid in future recovery. Several restoration projects have recently begun as awareness of historical loss grows amongst the community and groups become motivated to implement repair. As momentum continues to grow, Australia could serve as a long-term model for other regions that may currently have limited understanding of their shellfish reefs ecosystems but wish to work towards their future conservation. Data to be made publicly available with publication of manuscript by end 2018.</description>
            <description type="lineage">Identifying shellfish reef species
In light of the limited published information for reef-building species in Australia, we used a process of expert elicitation through members of the Australian Shellfish Reef Restoration Network (http://www.shellfishrestoration.org.au) to evaluate whether candidate bivalve species should be considered reef building in an Australian context. We evaluated species against predefined criteria: 1) that reefs were made from bivalves living in high densities and which form clearly definable, three-dimensional structures with either high or low vertical profiles 2) contain unique reef attributes such as shell accretion, increased hard surface availability and provision of food and habitats for other species and 3) form reefs at multiple locations throughout their normal distribution. We limited our review to those species that formed primary biogenic habitat on soft sediments and rocky areas rather than those which may form dense aggregations only on rocks, plants or animals. 

We acknowledge that a number of shellfish species not included in our review can develop reef-like systems or dense aggregations but we excluded these because they generally only occur under unique conditions (such as in the reverse estuary gulf systems of South Australia, see Discussion). Species that predominantly reside in sediments (endobenthic), such as Mesodesmatidae (surf clams), Cardiidae (cockles) and Donacidae (pipis) and some species of mussels (e.g. Limnoperna pulex, Xenostrobus inconstans) were excluded from the analysis, as were bivalve species that do not form aggregations dense enough to be considered reef-forming throughout their distribution (e.g. Pinna bicolour). 

Knowledge review: Indigenous and colonial use, historical harvest and regulation, past extent and current distributions
In 2015, The Australian National Environmental Science Programme supported a series of expert workshops and regionally focused reports which aimed to summarise Indigenous and early colonial use of shellfish reefs, historical harvest and regulation, past extent and current distributions and current or planned shellfish reef restoration projects [report findings summarised in 35]. We used this research as the basis of our review and identified further evidence through: 1) a systematic review of primary and secondary data sources likely to have information related to the nominated reef-building species 2) an appraisal of available oyster harvest records and newspaper accounts, 3) identification of historical or current shellfish aquaculture sites and 4) identification of localities where names are related to oysters and mussels (e.g. Oyster Harbour, Limeburners Bay). Methods undertaken to conduct 1-4 above are described below:

To conduct the systematic review,  we identified published journal articles for all nominated reef-forming species using Scopus (https://www.scopus.com/) supplemented by Google Scholar (https://scholar.google.com/). The search terms: ‘Australia’, ‘oyster’, ‘mussel’ and each of the species names listed in Table 1 were used to build a bibliography of all papers published up until to March 2016 (Table S1). We reviewed the primary objectives and results of each paper and categorised them according to several, non-discrete groups related to shellfish reef ecology, aquaculture or both. 

We considered early explorer accounts from 1770 and historical fisheries records maintained by state government fishery agencies from ~1850 to October 2015 for all coastal states (excluding the Northern Territory). We also searched historical newspaper articles for references to oyster fishing, harvesting, and/or dredging from 1800 to 1950 using the online database Trove - a national online catalogue of over 124 million newspaper articles maintained by the National Library of Australia (http://trove.nla.gov.au). We searched for locality names containing oyster*, Mussel* or Limeburner* using the online database Gazetteer of Australian Place Name Search (www.ga.gov.au) and obtained data on shellfish aquaculture locations from relevant state government agencies. 

To determine the past extent of shellfish reefs we followed the methods of Kirby [7], Zu Ermgassen et al. [13] and Alleway and Connell [37], where in the absence of quantitative data on shellfish density (e.g. commercial harvest records or ecological surveys), we applied a threshold approach as a proxy for shellfish reef extent, using the presence of commercial shellfish harvesting which occurred prior to 1950 as an indication of where oysters and mussels occurred in high densities (constituting a minimum harvestable threshold) and which likely formed reefs. We attributed historical commercial fishing to a location if a primary or secondary source was able to provide a description of: (1) commercial harvesting occurring at a specified location, (2) method of extraction (e.g. hand harvest, oyster dredge) and, where possible, (3) the amount of extraction (e.g. bags, bushels, number of oysters, tonnes). 

We used the presence of modern shellfish aquaculture as a second line of evidence for historical reef distribution, since historical accounts often described the development of shellfish aquaculture in the same locations as historical harvesting [35 and refs there in, 43, 44]. We used locality names of ‘Oyster*’ (e.g. Oyster Harbour) Mussel* and ‘Limeburner*’ (e.g. Limeburner’s Bay) as a third line of evidence to identify estuaries where shellfish abundance was clearly a historical distinguishing feature of the estuary or as further evidence that commercial fishing occurred in close proximity (e.g. oyster shells were burnt in kilns to make lime used in building materials- hence ‘Limeburners’). We attribute a locality name to a species only when a single reef-building species occurred for that location (i.e. O. angasi in southern Western Australia, South Australia, Victoria or Tasmania). Where multiple species occurred in a single location (i.e. S. glomerata, O. angasi in New South Wales, we assumed the locality was named after the species primarily harvested and sold at market (S. glomerata for New South Wales).

Not all states had comparable levels of data, for instance, early government fisheries records and maps from New South Wales are largely absent prior to September 1882, due to a fire at the Garden Palace Library in Sydney destroying all historical records. The current locations of O. angasi and S. glomerata reefs were identified by expert elicitation [35] because shellfish reef habitats are not currently classified or recorded in state or federal government habitat mapping databases. Existing reefs were identified if they were of comparable size to historic reefs (i.e. they were large enough to be considered as ‘commercially harvestable’ by small operators, nominally &amp;gt; 1 ha in size).</description>

            <description type="full">The files in this series document the processes undertaken by the Soldier Settlement Commission (VA 2270) and the Rural Finance and Settlement Commission (VA 2273) primarily, along with their successors, in developing estates for civilian land settlement. Six Land Settlement Estates were developed - Heytesbury, East Goulburn Irrigation Area, Yanakie, Rochester, Palpara and Dartmoor.&amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;VPRS 16290 Soldier Settlement Estates Development Files is a related series for the development of soldier settlement estates. There was an extensive overlap in the classifications of files developed for both types of estates e.g. Valuation-Purchase Lease, Subdivision, Statements for Commonwealth etc.&amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;BACKGROUND TO THE LAND SETTLEMENT SCHEME&amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;By the beginning of 1951 the Soldier Settlement Commission (SSC) (VA 2270) had decided to consider developing three major areas of Crown land - Heytesbury, Yanakie and Nyora. At a conference held on 8 February 1951, the feasibility of settlement in these areas was discussed and the Minister of Lands expressed interest in settlement opportunities for not only ex-servicemen but also for civilians who had not been in the war service.&amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;In December 1953, the Land Settlement Act  1953 (No. 5768) was passed, which opened up settlement opportunities for young civilian men without previous war service. The Land Settlement Act adopted the main provisions of the Soldier Settlement Act (no. 5107) for acquiring and setting apart land, although settlers could choose whether to finance their own farm development or accept assistance from the SSC. The enterprise was an initiative of the Victorian Government alone, whilst funded and administered through the SSC. &amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;The Soldier Settlement Commission&amp;#039;s 1952-3 Annual Report outlined experimental work that was undertaken in various Crown areas, including Heytesbury, which led to a confident prediction of successful dairying in the area. Preparation of undeveloped Crown land began at Heytesbury in 1956, by which time Victoria&amp;#039;s World War II Soldier Settlement program was starting to wind down. By 1958, land funded and developed under the Soldier Settlement Act at Heytesbury, Yanakie and East Goulburn was ready for transfer for civilian settlement. The land was officially transferred in 1959 under the Land Settlement Act (No. 6534). The first section of the Heytesbury settlement was opened in late 1959. By 1961 Civilian and Soldier Settlement schemes operated side by side at Yanakie, the first civilian settlers having been allocated blocks during that year. Yanakie&amp;#039;s second-stage development was completed by 1965. &amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;Dairy farm development at Heytesbury ceased in the 1970s and during the 1980s the remaining land was gradually sold publicly in various-sized lots. In March 1988 an area of 1,039 hectares was transferred to the Department of Conservation, Forests and Lands for softwood production. The Rural Finance Corporation (II) (VA 2985) held a final clearing sale on 24 May 1989, which included the sale of vehicles, horses, hay and office furniture and equipment. All activities were finalised on 1 June 1989.&amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;The true series date range is uncertain as it was not possible to determine precisely when the recordkeeping activities underpinning the estate development process began and ended. The series appears to contain material from a number of recordkeeping systems, although the majority of files are unnumbered. A series start date of 1956 has been chosen as this was the year that major development began on the Heytesbury estate. Some documents predate 1956, including reports and correspondence of the Virgin Land Investigation Committee, established in 1949, to recommend Crown land which appeared most suitable for the SSC to investigate in detail. The committee visited Yanakie early in 1950, an area that would eventually be occupied by both soldier and civilian settlers. However, the majority of files in the series date from 1956 to 1976 - the most intensive period of land development. Documents were added to files after this date but only a small number of new files were created.&amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;A series end date of 1989 has been chosen as this was the year that the Rural Finance Corporation II (VA 2985) conducted its final clearing sale for the Heytesbury project. The last file of the series was generated during this year.&amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;Many files from this series were destroyed at some time in the past. This series constitutes those files that survived.&amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;</description>

            <description type="full">The Marine chapter of the 2016 State of the Environment (SoE) report incorporates multiple expert templates developed from streams of marine data. This metadata record describes the Case Study "Southern bluefin tuna". The full Case Study, including figures and tables (where provided), is attached to this record. Where available, the Data Stream(s) used to generate this Case Study are accessible through the "On-line Resources" section of this record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE FOCUS OF THE CASE STUDY
Southern bluefin tuna (SBT) are an important apex predator within Australia’s marine environment with juveniles seasonally aggregating in the Great Australian Bight during the summer, subadults and adults utilising southern and south-eastern waters primarily during the winter months and adults aggregating in an areas off the north western region of Australia primarily during the spring and summer months on the only spawning ground for the species.
Southern bluefin tuna are a highly prized target species of international commercial and national recreational fisheries. Within Australian waters, a purse-seine fishery catches juvenile (2-4 yr old) SBT in the waters of the Great Australian Bight during the summer months, and is of significant value to the regional economy (~$150M annually). A longline fishery targeting large SBT off the eastern Australian seaboard during the winter months catches a smaller amount of Australia’s commercial allocation.

ISSUES OF IMPORTANCE
The SBT spawning biomass (a measure of the adult population) is estimated to have been depleted by fishing to a low fraction of its original size. The depleted nature of the stock has led to the listing of SBT as Conservation Dependent under the EPBC Act and Critically Endangered by the IUCN. Unaccounted mortalities associated with discards, unreported catches and recreational catches of SBT can impact on achieving current stock rebuilding targets set by the CCSBT.

DATA STREAM(S) USED IN CASE STUDY
The case study is based on stock assessment information produced in annual reports of the Extended Scientific Committee and the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna. Assessments are based on data relating to fishery catches, aerial surveys and close-kin mark recapture methods covering the spatial area of the Commission and a temporal period of 1951-2014.</description>

            <description type="lineage">- Track identification -

During the first summer season tracks were studied for overall species crawl patterns and for characteristics suitable to measure.  Track measurements were made of individual flipper widths, overall track width, central belly channel width and individual flipper imprint offset from each other.  This was done randomly at three different locations on each track, up and down.  

A fast and simple method using a metre stick was developed and tested.  The species making the track was identified and the presence or absence of the adult noted.  Where possible the track was measured on the flat dry sand.  The total track width was measured at its widest point (="width"), the belly drag/channel width was measured at its widest point (="belly") and then the rear flipper impressions made in a 1m length of track were counted (="stroke/m").

Measurements were also taken from hatchling tracks to determine if species identification could be done using the track size.  The total track width was measured from the outside edge of adjacent rear flipper imprints.  Where possible, hatchling track measurements were done on dry sand and on the flat part of the beach.

- Physical characteristics and light environment of beaches -

Preliminary assessment of nesting habitats were carried out for all beaches following standardised methods (diez and Ottenwalder 1999).  Physical features such as beach accessibility, dimensions, wave energy conditions and foreshore topography were recorded.  Each beach was assessed for quality of nesting habitat.  The amount of available habitat is represented by beach width and sand depth.  Beach lengths and widths were measured from aerial photograph of islands.  The accessibility of each beach to nesting sea turtles was evaluated based on foreshore and beach characteristics.  For further methodology see section 3.3.2 of thesis.

- Track count survey beach selection, access and timing -

The size and remoteness of the study area precluded detailed on-ground track count survey.  Consequently a survey program was designed to provide a mix of aerial and ground truthing surveys.  Regular on ground surveys were primarily employed on Barrow and the Lowendal Islands (OG), while aerial surveys (A) were the primary method used for the more remote island group of the Montebello group in conjunction with limited ground truthing transects (T).

The survey schedule is listed in Table 3.1 of the thesis.  Preliminary surveys were carried out over the 1998/1999 nesting season at all locations.  Surveys were timed to coincide with the predicted peak of nesting for the three species (Hawksbill, Flatback and Green turtle), i.e. one in early summer (November or December) and the second in mid summer (January).  Where possible selected beaches on Barrow, Lowendal and Montebello islands were surveyed over three consecutive days (a) while all beaches were inspected at least once a season (b) to document evidence of current and past nesting as determined by tracks (current season) and nest craters (current and past seasons).  With limited resources this was all that could be achieved.  Opportunistic surveys of various beaches were also conducted outside of the regular monitoring schedule where other project work allowed.  

For further information see section 3.3.3 of the thesis.

- Track counts -

The method employed to carry out the Barrow, Lowendal and Montebello island complex nesting beach aerial and ground track surveys were based on the recommendations made by Schroeder and Murphy (1999).

Attempts were made to assign an age to tracks, however this was abandoned since environmental factors made it difficult to accurately date individual tracks.  Factors that influenced the persistence of tracks and therefore confounded estimates of age included wind and rain weathering, beach sediment grain size, beach orientation with respect to the prevailing winds and animal size (heavier green turtles leave deeper track impressions than the lighter hawksbills).

Two different overnight track counts were made.  These were fresh below high tide (BHT) counts and fresh overnight line cross (x-line) counts.

BHT counts - 
Fresh tracks below last high tide (BHT) counts were made of down tracks traversing the beach after the previous night's high tide.  These counts did not include animals nesting prior to the high tide (generally underestimates the number of animals visiting over three consecutive days and for aerial counts.  As a minimum these counts were carried out on all beaches surveyed (including census beaches) within the B-L-M complex between 1998 and 2003.

x-line counts - 
During the first summer of preliminary regional track count surveys a number of beaches that were identified as having high-density nesting were selected as representative 'census' beaches for ongoing surveys investigating the impacts of light on sea turtle adults and hatchlings.  The number of overnight turtle nesting attempts was enumerated using the x-line track census method over a minimum of three consecutive days.  The results provide an indication of the number of animals using individual beaches.  This data was then used to quantify the proportion of the nesting population potentially exposed to light.

Cross line (x line) counts were made of tracks crossing a line installed along the beach above the high tide line.  These counts include all animals nesting during the previous night.  This census count was used on beaches that could be visited over three consecutive days and was used on Barrow Island and the Lowendal Islands between 1998 and 2003 and then on Barrow Island only between 2003 and 2005.  

The application of each of these different count types is presented as:

- Beach preferences (BHT)
- Length and peak of nesting season (x-line)
- Track to nest ratio (x-line)
- Distribution of track crawls between and within island groups (BHT)
- Beach usage, Barrow and Lowendal islands (x-line)

Proceedings of the Royal Society Series B 10.1098/rspb.2012.2100


Methods:

We surveyed three leeward reef sites at Pelorus Island (figure 1). At each site, four belt transects (1 m width, 20 m length) were surveyed on SCUBA at 4–6 m depth. Surficial death assemblages were collected by hand on SCUBA at eight points (n = ?40 fragments per point) at random across a single 20 m transect at each site. From these collections, fragments of the dominant genus/growth form present in death assemblages were identified, and samples were selected for U-series dating haphazardly (i.e. with no bias for taphonomic state of fragments). Sample fragments were sectioned laterally, and a sub-sample (2–3 g) of skeleton was taken from the cleanest section (i.e. unaffected by internal bioerosion) in closest proximity to the growth margin. Approximately 1 g of carefully cleaned material from each sub-sample was used for thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS) and multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (MC-ICPMS) U-series dating (Roff et al 2013 for more information)


Format of the data:

The dataset comprises of U-Th data obtained using thermal ionisation mass spectrometry (TIMS) and multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC ICP-MS). Data is presented in a table in a word file (&amp;lt;Roff et al. 2013. U-series dates&amp;gt;) with values for uranium concentration (U ppm), 232Th concentration (ppb), measured 230Th/232Th (activity ratio), 230Th/238U (activity ratio), ?234U (activity ratio), uncorrected and corrected 230Th age (in years), time of chemistry (years AD) and corrected 230Th age (years AD).

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The School of Ecosystem and Forest Sciences lantern glass slide collection is part of the Creswick Campus Historical Collection which contains an estimated 12,000 objects, documents and photographs relating to the more than one hundred years of forestry education at the University of Melbourne’s Creswick Campus. It is a diverse, well-provenanced and unique collection, and one of great historical, aesthetic, research and social significance.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The SEFS lantern glass slide collection comprises of a photographic slide collection of 952 glass slides compiled to provide knowledge about trees and forests in Victoria as well as about their environmental location. The collection includes pictures of landscape erosion, watersheds, waterways, and grazing areas' degradation in various parts of Victoria, as well as trees after bushfires, logging, and road-building in forested areas. These slides were in use from 1910 through till the 1950’s.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;quot;As a researcher of bushfire behaviour and impact on communities, the collection provides a range of opportunities to examine the nature of past events and how the community has responded. These data are difficult to obtain due to the infrequent nature of such events, and collections such as the SEFS lantern glass slide collection are invaluable.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

            <description type="lineage">As part of the search for oil in Australia, West Australian Petroleum Pty. Ltd. and the Bureau of Mineral Resources have both been carrying out extensive geological and geophysical surveys in the Canning Basin of Western
Australia during the past few years. Western Australian Petroleum Pty. Ltd. is currently drilling a deep test bore
on Dampier Land.

As a contribution towards assessing the oil potential of the Basin, the Bureau carried out a seismic survey along a
traverse near Langey' s Crossing, with the object of obtaining information on the thickness of the sedimentary rocks and on the geological structure of the sedimentary rocks at depth. The traverse extends for ten miles south-west along the Derby-Broome telegraph line, from a point about two miles west of the Fitzroy River, north of Langey's Crossing. The direction of the traverse is oblique to the direction of major faulting and folding in the Fitzroy Basin.

The survey was made in July, 1955 by a seismic party in which B.R. Smith (party leader) and N.J. Goodspeed
were the geophysicists. Topographic surveying was done by the Department of the Interior, Perth, and the shot-hole
drilling by the Petroleum Technology Section of the Bureau.</description>

            <description type="brief">As a contribution towards the assessment of the oil potential of the Canning Basin, the Bureau carried out
a seismic survey in July, 1955 along a traverse to the north-west of Lansey's Cross ing in the Kimberley Division of Western Australia. There is a considerable thickness of sedimentary rocks, probably exceeding 20,000 feet, in the nearby Fitzroy Basin, but little is known of the structure of the Canning Basin. The object of the survey was to obtain information on the thickness of the sedimentary rocks in this part of the Basin and on thc geologicul structure of the sedimentary rocks at depth.

The results show that near Langey's Crossing the thicknes s of the sedimentary rocks probably exceeds 16,000 feet and may exceed 20,000 feet. The traverse was oblique to the assumed. direction of the axes of the major structure in the basin and results indicate that it crosses the axis of what appears to be a broad syncline of low relief.</description>

Salinity data flagged as 'suspect, uncalibrated', as no calibration samples collected. Applied conductivity calibration from Fr04/2002, which seems to have improved the accuracy. The difference between the primary and secondary sensors (both temperature &amp; conductivity) is 'noisier' than experienced in the past (see processing report). The combination of this 'noise' and incorrect calibration factors could give salinity errors of up to 0.0035 psu.&amp;lt;BR&amp;gt; The transmissometer data for deployments 1-35 (collected with a Chelsea AquaTracker) is degraded by temperature &amp; hysteresis effects. Deployments 36-40 were collected using a SeaTech unit, and have much better data quality 'noise'.&amp;lt;BR&amp;gt; For full details, refer to documentation.</description>

            <description type="lineage">As Landsat Imagery becomes more readily available, there has been a rapid increase in the amount of analyses undertaken by researchers around the globe.  Most researchers use some form of quality masking schema in order to remove undesirable pixels from analysis, whether that be cloud, cloud shadow, observations over the ocean, or  saturated pixels.  In the past, researchers would reject partly cloud-affected scenes in favour of cloud-free scenes.  However, Landsat time series analysis using all cloud-free pixels has become a valuable technique and has increased the demand for automation of cloud, cloud shadow and saturation detection.  Emergency response applications such as flood mapping typically have to contend with individual cloud affected scenes and therefore rely on effective cloud and cloud shadow removal techniques. 
The PQ25 product combines established algorithms that detect clouds including the Automated Cloud Cover Assessment (ACCA) (Irish et al. 2006) and Function of mask (Fmask) (Zhu and Woodcock 2012) . ACCA is already widely used within the remote sensing community; it is fast and relatively accurate.  Fmask on the other hand is newer, but is rapidly becoming more established, and can provide a more accurate cloud mask than ACCA in certain cloud environments. 
The sensor saturation flagging protocols developed for the Web Enabled Landsat Data (WELD) product as described in Roy et al. (2011) are used to flag sensor saturation.
The PQ25 product has similarities to the QAB layer packaged with OLI data, however it uses additional algorithms to detect cloud and cloud shadow, and is available for Landsats 5, 7 and 8.</description>

            <description type="brief">The PQ25 product facilitates interpretation and processing of Surface Reflectance (SR-N/NT),  Fractional Cover 25 (FC25) and all derivative products.
PQ25 is an assessment of each image pixel to determine if it is an unobscured, unsaturated observation of the Earth's surface and also whether the pixel is represented in each spectral band. The PQ product allows users to produce masks which can be used to exclude pixels which don't meet their quality criteria from analysis . The capacity to automatically exclude such pixels is essential for emerging multi-temporal analysis techniques that make use of every quality assured pixel within a time series of observations.
Users can choose to process only land pixels, or only sea pixels depending on their analytical requirements, leading to enhanced computationally efficient.</description>

Data is provided for two global ocean sea-ice models using the Modular Ocean Model (MOM) at 1/4° horizontal resolution (MOM025; 50 vertical levels) and 1/10° horizontal resolution (MOM01; 75 vertical levels). It also contains velocity anomalies from the same wind perturbation experiment in a single-layer shallow water model using the Regional Ocean Modelling System (ROMS) at 1/4° horizontal resolution. The ROMS zonal and meridional velocity fields, U and V, cover a one-year period with a 0.5 day temporal resolution. Barotropic U and V fields for MOM025 are given at a 5 daily temporal resolution (over a one-year period) and a subset of the MOM01 U and V fields are given at a 6 hourly temporal resolution. Temperature fields, T, are calculated from the average of the annual (MOM01) and seasonal (MOM025) 10 member ensembles from the respective model mean-states.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

            <description type="full">All the available data sets containing diatom counts were compiled. These data sets were the 166 database used by Pichon et al. (1992), new data gathered separately by Dr Pichon (1994) and the author (L. Armand-1997), and Abbott's (1973) southeast Indian Ocean surface sample data set. 

Since each of the data sets were developed over periods of years or were subject to differences in processing and taxonomy, primary analysis was concerned with aligning current taxonomic advances and knowledge against the record of species identified in each data. With exception only to the Abbott southeast Indian Ocean data set (which could no longer be located for verification), the remaining data sets were combined and subjected to taxonomic reform. 

Following taxonomic reform a core-top diatom database was compiled using sample-selection criteria and through the removal of samples representing unique environmental regimes (i.e. Antarctic Peninsula region). A total of 115 samples from an original 194 remained available for use, and is identified as the Antarctic Diatom Database (ADB).</description>

            <description type="brief">&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
    The subduction dataset (global subduction and back-arc basin grids and data) includes grid data and images illustrating the global and regional subduction and back-arc basin formation. The investigators examined kinematic controls on subduction and back-arc basins for the present-day and Cenozoic to differentiate between major competing hypotheses for back-arc basin formation, and explain their temporal and spatial distribution.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
    The subduction dataset includes ten related datasets:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;
        Global subduction age grid images&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;
        Global subduction parameter dataset&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;
        Tonga-Kermadec subduction system&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;
        Java-Sunda subduction system&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;
        Izu-Bonin-Mariana subduction system&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;
        Aleutian subduction system&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

Australia&amp;apos;s RMIT University is ranked 16th in the world for art and design, which positions it as the top art school in the country. The School of Art fosters innovative and diverse art practice and research within visual art, fine art, public art, and arts management

PROJECT SPACE is a gallery that links prominent exemplars of practice-based research with Melbourne&amp;#8217;s creative communities through a dynamic program of contemporary art projects. Housed in RMIT University&amp;apos;s Building 94, it runs a dynamic program of exhibitions and events from February to December.

SPARE ROOM is a gallery space adjacent to PROJECT SPACE in RMIT&amp;apos;s Building 94. Both of these gallery programs are aligned such that exhibitions launch and run together and are often conceptually linked. SPARE ROOM acts as a small space for large ideas&amp;#8212;it is a keyhole into a rich variety of potential conversations, from blue skies to deep dives.

            <description type="lineage">The Water Observations from Space product (WOfS) is a key component of the National Flood Risk Information Portal (NFRIP), developed by Geoscience Australia (GA). The objective of Water Observations from Space is to analyse GA's historic archive of satellite imagery to derive water observations, to help understand where flooding may have occurred in the past, and hence help inform on areas under threat of flooding in future.

WOfS is being developed in parallel with the National Flood Studies Database system which will provide Flood Study documentation and reports to a wide range of users. Both systems will be delivered via the internet through the NFRIP portal.

Satellite imagery has been used to map floods around the world for several years. Organisations such as the Colorado Flood Observatory in the USA and several state-based agencies in Australia regularly provide satellite-based flood extents for major flood events. GA developed a flood mapping methodology in 2008-2009 that was extensively used for the major Australian flood events since 2010, providing emergency service agencies with regional flood extent information.

The Phase 1 outputs from the NFRIP were delivered to the public in November 2012, including a proof of concept of WOfS. This displayed surface water extents for three study areas, including the original derived extents and the cumulative summary product. Subsequent stakeholder feedback has shown that the most desirable information is the summary product, providing and understanding of the long term dynamics of surface water.

The Phase 2 outputs from the NFRIP (release in April 2014), included the release of WOfS v1.0, which is accessible to the public as a web service from the NFRIP and from http://eos.ga.gov.au.

The current version of WOfS has separated the individual time slices from the derived summary statistics. The time slices, termed Water Observation Feature Layers (WOFLs) are contained in WO_25_2.1.5, while the summary statistics are contained in WO-STATS_25_2.1.5.</description>

            <description type="brief">Water Observations from Space (WOfS) provides surface water observations derived from satellite imagery for all of Australia from 1986 to the present. The WOfS product allows users to get a better understanding of where water is normally present in a landscape, where water is seldom observed, and where inundation has occurred occasionally. WOfS displays the detected surface water from cloud-free Landsat observations for the whole of Australia.</description>

            <description type="full">Seven case study locations (Keep, Daly, Roper, McArthur, Flinders, and Gilbert River estuaries, and Darwin Harbour) were used to test the utility of the Australian Landsat data archive in the Digital Earth Australia analysis platform for characterising and monitoring the condition and change in coastal habitats. A suite of analyses was undertaken including: assessing the extent of different coastal habitats, detecting coastal change including change in mangrove communities, and the distribution of intertidal areas. The work was successful in: (a) generating baseline information for the case study areas; and, (b) developing valuable monitoring tools for future use.</description>
            <description type="lineage">Intertidal areas were identified using the DEA archive based on modelled tide height that occurred at the time of image acquisition. This analysis utilises an advanced image classification scheme that enables viewing of coastal regions at selected tide stages. In this approach, composite images of coastal regions over varying stages of the tide and varying time periods are generated as a way of showing coastal change. Furthermore, this tidally attributed archive of coastal imagery enables mapping of intertidal extents, which effectively characterises the topography of intertidal zones. This project looked specifically at the effectiveness of mapping changes in mangrove extent over the past 30 years in the nominated priority estuaries.</description>

            <description type="brief">The report is a quarterly report with a consistent and regular assessment of crop prospects for major field crops, forecasts of area, yield and production and a summary of seasonal conditions on a state by state basis. 

 Key issues  
• Harvesting of winter crops is largely complete across the country following a mixed season. Total winter crop production is estimated to have decreased by 36 per cent to 37.8 million tonnes in 2017-18. This is an upward revision of 8 per cent from the ABARES forecast published in the December 2017 Australian crop report. This largely reflects yields being better than anticipated in some regions following very favourable seasonal conditions during spring and early summer in these regions. 
• Production is estimated to have fallen in 2017-18 for three major crops: wheat by 38 per cent to 21.2 million tonnes, barley by 33 per cent to 8.9 million tonnes and canola by 15 per cent to 3.7 million tonnes. 
• Planting of summer crops is now largely complete and total area planted to summer crops is estimated to have increased by 3 per cent to 1.3 million hectares in 2017-18. This is a downward revision of 9 per cent from the forecast ABARES published in the December 2017 edition of Australian crop report. This revision reflects seasonal conditions in December and January that were unfavourable for the planting of grain sorghum. 
• Area planted to cotton is estimated to have fallen by 10 per cent in 2017-18 to 500,000 hectares. Area planted to grain sorghum is estimated to be 501,000 hectares, an increase of 26 per cent from the small area planted in 2016-17. Late season planting of grain sorghum is expected to be minimal because of unfavourable seasonal conditions over the past three months. These conditions are also expected to adversely affect yields and production is forecast to fall to 1.5 million tonnes.

            <description type="brief">Overview  

 This report presents detailed financial performance estimates for lamb producers for 2013-14 to 2015-16, with an emphasis on 2014-15 results. Lamb producing farms are defined as those Australian broadacre farm businesses that sold, on average, 200 or more lambs for slaughter a year over the three years ending 2014-15. 

 The report draws on data from the ABARES annual Australian Agricultural and Grazing Industries Survey (AAGIS). This survey has been conducted by ABARES and its predecessors since 1977-78 and provides government and industry stakeholders with important data for analysing and monitoring changes in Australia's broadacre industries. 

 Meat &amp; Livestock Australia commissioned and funded this report. 


 Key Issues  
• Farm cash income of lamb producing farms rose on average over the period 2013-14 to 2014-15. The majority of the rise in farm incomes came from higher beef and lamb receipts due to increased prices and sales for both commodities. Average farm cash income of lamb producing farms is estimated to have increased further in 2015-16 mainly as a result of increased crop, wool and beef cattle sales. 
• Average incomes of lamb producing farms are estimated to have risen from 2014-15 to 2015-16 in New South Wales, Queensland and South Australia. The majority of the increase in farm incomes in these states was from higher cropping receipts. 
• In real terms, the estimated average farm incomes for 2014-15 and 2015-16 were among the highest recorded since 2001-02. 
• Rate of return (excluding capital appreciation) for lamb producers fell marginally from 2.6 per cent in 2013-14 to 2.5 per cent in 2014-15. The average rate of return is estimated to have increased in 2015-16 to around 3.0 per cent, reflecting higher incomes. 
• Average debt for lamb producers increased in real terms by around 88 per cent from $323 000 in 2000-01 (in 2015-16 dollars) to an estimated $605 000 in 2015-16. Increases in average debt over the past 15 years have been largely the consequence of increases in average farm size and borrowing for land purchase, as well as for ongoing working capital. 
• Overall, changes in average debt over time have been modest relative to lamb producers' capacity to service debt by generating income. On average, around 8 per cent of lamb producers' farm cash receipts were used to make interest payments over the 10 years to 2015-16. In 2015-16 an estimated 6 per cent of farm cash receipts were used to make interest payments.

            <description type="brief">Overview  
 This technical report estimates the responsiveness of demand for structural pine to changes in timber and steel prices. Measures of demand responsiveness can provide valuable insights into the potential implications of changes in policy or market settings on volumes and prices received by producers. The analysis focuses on estimating short-term price elasticities of demand-a formal measure of the sensitivity of demand-to changes in prices in the same quarter or recent past. 

 Key Issues  
 The estimates in this report suggest that the importance of timber and steel prices on the quantity of structural timber demanded in the short-run is limited. However, the volume of residential construction activity was found to have a substantial effect for demand of domestically produced structural pine products. In particular, new house commencements explain a great deal of the quarter-on-quarter changes in the quantity of domestic structural pine sales. This confirms the common assertion by industry that house commencements are the primary driver for structural timber demand within Australia. 

 Looking forward, changes in consumer preferences, socio-demographic trends and building regulations will likely play a much greater role in the choice of building materials used in housing construction compared with timber and steel prices. Trends suggest consumers are placing more weight on the environmental benefits of structural materials. Changing architectural styles will change the material requirements for a standard home. A global trend towards higher-density living will likely promote a shift toward multi-unit buildings, with recent changes to the National Construction Code opening the way for increased timber use in the midrise construction market, leading to greater timber use in multi-level buildings.

            <description type="brief">ABARES Lessons from the water market report analyses trends in water allocation prices in the southern Murray-Darling Basin (sMDB), between 2000-01 and 2015-16. This report analyses the major demand and supply side drivers of water allocation prices in the sMDB, drawing on historical data for 2000-01 to 2015-16. The study disentangles the effects of climate variability (rainfall, water storage and allocation volumes) from the key policy changes (including Commonwealth purchase of entitlements for the environment) and irrigation sector changes that have occurred during the period. 

Key Issues • The main driver of change in water prices over this period has been variation in rainfall, storages and allocations. During the peak of the drought water prices jumped to more than $1 000 per ML, before dropping to near zero during the flood years (2010-11 and 2011-12). Between 2011-12 and 2015-16, storage volumes steadily decreased and prices steadily increased. 
• However, ABARES finds that even after controlling for these dry conditions, market prices during 2014-15 and 2015-16 were higher than expected from past experience. The report finds that these higher prices can be explained by a combination of demand and supply factors including: Commonwealth entitlement purchases, state carryover rule changes, interregional trade restrictions and commodity price fluctuations and irrigation land-use changes. 
• While Commonwealth entitlement purchases reduce the supply of water and have an upward effect on prices, these are offset to some extent by Commonwealth investments in water saving infrastructure. Further, even if water savings are ignored, Commonwealth entitlement purchases offer only a partial explanation for the increase in water prices. 
• Another important factor has been changes to carryover rules particularly in Victoria, which have led to large increases in carryover volumes since 2007-08. This increase carryover since 2007-08 has contributed to higher allocation prices in the market. Despite this, carryover remains a positive development that will benefit irrigators in the long run by keeping prices lower in drought years.

            <description type="brief">Overview  
 The ABARES report presents estimates of the economic impact of a hypothetical outbreak of scrapie in Australia's sheep and goat population under three disease spread scenarios: • eradicable epidemic - an outbreak occurs and is successfully eradicated 
• managed spread - eradication is unsuccessful and spread is slowed by control measures 
• uncontrolled spread - without control measures in place, the disease spreads uncontrolled. 

 ABARES also estimated the trade impacts that may result following an outbreak of scrapie. Due to uncertainty around the extent of export market disruptions, three export ban scenarios by China, Japan and the Republic of Korea were modelled - as these countries have been sensitive to outbreaks of notifiable livestock diseases in the past. 

 The ABARES report indicates that Australia benefits significantly from remaining free of scrapie, and that in the event of an outbreak, it would also likely benefit from measures to eradicate the disease or control its spread. 

Key Issues 
 Scrapie is a progressive neurodegenerative disease affecting sheep and goats. It belongs to the group of livestock diseases which includes mad cow disease (bovine spongiform encephalopathy or BSE) in cattle. Scrapie (unlike BSE) is not associated with any known human health risks. Australia is one of the few major sheep producing countries that is free of scrapie and only allows imports of live sheep or genetic material under strict conditions from selected countries. 

    Australia would benefit significantly from preventing the entry of scrapie, and from detecting it relatively early if it enters. If detected within 10 years of entry, efforts to eradicate the disease are likely to be both successful and cost effective. Eradication would likely be achieved an average of eight years after detection of the disease, but outbreaks could last up to 50 years. 

 If detected early enough to be eradicable, modelled costs of controlling and eradicating scrapie-ncluding income losses from movement restrictions, were modest-estimated at an average of $4.7 million (in 2016 dollars). Most of the economic impact from an eradicable outbreak came from trade losses. 
• For example, if the outbreak led to a three-month ban on sheep meat by China and Japan, and a three-month ban on beef by Korea, the estimated trade losses would be $70 million over 10 years, of which $36 million would be lost by the beef industry. 
• A three-month ban on beef to Korea is based on existing agreed certification with Korea requiring Australian exporters to include an attestation that Australia is free of scrapie on export certificates for a range of beef and sheep meat products.. 

 An eradication campaign is estimated to yield a benefit-cost ratio between 5:1 and 10:1, based on an assumed cost of $3 million to run epidemic control centres. 

 If the disease was not detected in time to be eradicable, it would still be cost-effective for Australia to implement measures to slow the spread. ABARES estimated the cost of uncontrolled spread to be in excess of $406 million (in 2016 dollars), compared to the estimated $119 million to $150 million cost of slowing the spread. </description>

            <description type="brief">ABARES latest outlook for Australia's key agricultural commodities in 2014-15, which updates the forecasts ABARES released in September 2014. 
 Commodity forecasts  
• Earnings from farm exports are forecast to fall by 8.6 per cent in 2014-15 to around $37.6 billion. At this forecast level, export earnings in 2014-15 would be around 4 per cent above the average of $36.2 billion over the past decade to 2013-14 in real terms. 
• The forecast fall in farm export earnings largely reflects expected falls in earnings from cotton (down 37 per cent), barley (36 per cent), canola (44 per cent), wheat (10 per cent) and dairy (20 per cent). 
• Export earnings are forecast to increase for beef and veal (up 6 per cent), lamb (12 per cent), sugar (7 per cent), live feeder/slaughter cattle (5 per cent) and live sheep (62 per cent). 
• Earnings from crop exports are forecast to fall by 15.2 per cent to $19.3 billion in 2014-15, following a decline of 1.4 per cent in the previous year. 
• Export earnings from livestock and livestock products are forecast to fall slightly to $18.3 billion in 2014-15, following an increase of 22.6 per cent in the previous year. 
• Export earnings from fisheries products are forecast to increase by 3.3 per cent in 2014-15 to around $1.3 billion, following an increase of 11 per cent in 2013-14. 
• The index of unit export returns for Australian farm exports is forecast to decline by 1.8 per cent in 2014-15, following a rise of 7.4 per cent in 2013-14. 
• Higher export prices are forecast for beef, sheep meat and wine in 2014-15, while export prices of wheat, barley, cotton and dairy products are forecast to decline. 
• The gross value of farm production is forecast to fall by 5 per cent in 2014-15 to about $50.7 billion, following an estimated increase of 10 per cent to $53.4 billion in 2013-14. 
• The volume index of farm production is forecast to decrease by 5.9 per cent in 2014-15, following an estimated rise of 5.5 per cent in 2013-14.

            <description type="brief">Overview  

 Wheat stem rust has been present in Australia for over a century. The most recent and severe outbreak in Australia was the 1973 epidemic. However, a potentially damaging strain of the disease, Ug99, which was detected in Uganda in 1999 and currently not present in Australia, is a major concern as around 30 per cent of Australian current wheat varieties show moderate to high susceptibility to the Ug99 strain. 

 ABARES estimated the potential economic impact of a Ug99 outbreak on the Australian wheat industry for three wheat growing areas. An outbreak in Western Australia is estimated to cost the wheat industry over a 10-year period a total of $567 million, an outbreak in south-eastern Australia $803 million and an Australia-wide outbreak $1,362 million. These costs were based on the assumption that Ug99 has entered, established and spread to the full extent for each outbreak scenario, and did not lead to trade bans by wheat importers. 

 The study estimated significant benefits in continuing to invest in biosecurity prevention, ranging from $28 million to $70 million a year, depending on the extent of spread and whether or not trade bans were imposed by wheat importers. 

 Ongoing research and development (R&amp;D) to secure seed stocks of Ug99 resistant varieties plays an important role in reducing potential future industry losses. The wheat industry losses avoided by securing seed stocks of Ug99 resistant varieties, and switching to these varieties immediately following any future entry, is one example of the benefits that can be derived from past biosecurity R&amp;D. 

Key Issues 
• Wheat stem rust has been present in Australia for over a century. 
• The most recent and severe outbreak of the disease in Australia was the 1973 epidemic. 
• Ug99 is a particularly damaging strain of the disease not present in Australia, but is a concern. 
• The severity of an outbreak depends largely on the extent of susceptible wheat varieties grown and suitability of climate to the fungal disease. 
• Around 30 per cent of Australian current wheat varieties show moderate to high susceptibility to the Ug99 strain. 
• Wheat varietal improvement has resulted in fewer wheat stem rust incidences since the major outbreak. 
• Governments and the industry should continue to invest in varietal improvements which provide resistance to emerging strains.

It should be noted that this data is now somwhat dated!

Land protected from development through land-use zoning is relatively free
from human activities that lead to habitat destruction and species decline.
Land-use zoning is a planning tool. In general protected lands are not subject
to land-use changes at the catchment scale. Wetlands or streams connected
hydrologically to other catchments will be vulnerable to upstream/catchment
impacts.

The Collaborative Australian Protected Areas Database (CAPAD) at Environment
Australia has protected areas mapped at the 1:250K scale. The dataset has been
compiled from cadastre data which is mapped at finer scales than 1:250K and is
considered to have excellent spatial precision. Data reliability is high.

The indicator is not a measure of pristine condition, as many protected areas
have different zonings in the past and been subject to activities which have
led to habitat decline. There are also different classes of protection and
different sizes of area protected, some of which may be too small to conserve
biodiversity. However, further decline is prevented through their current
protected status, and in this sense % area of protected land indicates future
viability for those habitats represented within protected areas. Protected
areas will change through time.

Nature conservation areas such as national parks provide relatively stable
systems where biota and landscapes are protected from many forms of
disturbance. In higher rainfall areas with steeper slopes a protected area in
the headwaters of a catchment may convey substantial benefits, particularly to
downstream waterways and to neighbouring areas as refuge for wildlife. Where
the protected areas are in the lower reaches of catchments, the value of
protected areas for nature conservation are still high but the benefit to
water coming from further up the catchment will be less. In drier, flatter
catchments protected areas will probably not contribute substantially to the
condition of surrounding areas in the catchment. For example, a salt lake
national park will have little beneficial effect on the surrounding lands. In
these cases the aggregation of small area catchments in relatively good
condition to larger AWRC basins is misleading because the benefits are
spatially restricted. The overall picture as shown by the 500 and 5A5 maps is
dominated by the lowest category.

The AWRC map gives a quite misleading picture, missing large areas that are
not protected and giving a better than average picture for much of S and the
NT. Major areas with relatively good protection are: southwestern Tasmania,
East Gippsland and southern New South Wales, the Blue Mountains, parts of the
Border Ranges and the New England Plateau, the Alligator Rivers region (NT),
parts of Victoria River Downs, Purnululu, and areas north and west of Ceduna
(SA). In the relatively poorest class are central and northern parts of the
Murray-Darling Basin, the Burnett, Burdekin and Mitchell catchments (Qld), the
Daly and Fitzmaurice River catchments (NT), most catchments in WA, and
catchments of the Mount Lofty Ranges (SA).

            <description type="brief">Overview  
 The report A stocktake of selected agricultural markets of the European Union: Opportunities for Australia compiles five articles on EU agricultural industries that were originally published in ABARES Agricultural Commodities quarterly reports between June 2016 and March 2017. These articles were on almonds, beef, dairy, sheep meat and sugar. The report examines EU domestic policies and markets, and trade opportunities for Australia. 

 Key Issues  
• Since the mid 1990s the share of total Australian exports destined for the EU has been declining in favour of more lucrative and geographically closer Asian markets. 
• Part of the reason for the decline in the share of Australian exports to the EU has been caused by the regulation that supports the EU agricultural sector. EU agricultural imports are subject to restrictive quotas, in-quota tariffs and prohibitive out-of-quota tariffs. 
• The Australian Government and the European Commission are working towards commencing negotiations for a free trade agreement. As the European Union is one of the largest consumers of agricultural goods in the world, a preferential agreement that improves access to the EU market may present opportunities for Australian agricultural exporters. 
• The commodities covered in this report are almonds, beef, dairy, sheep meat and sugar. These are high value or growing Australian agricultural industries. 
• The EU imports agricultural products from a large number of countries and has numerous existing trade arrangements with these countries. Australia therefore faces significant competition in the EU market for the five commodities. 
• The articles discuss the existing trade trends and EU policies for each of the five commodities. For beef, dairy and sugar it is posited that only a significant reduction in tariffs or enlargement of quotas would precipitate a strong diversion of Australian trade away from the geographically closer Asian markets to the European Union. This is because of weakening EU import demand given growing supplies of lower-priced, domestically produced product. 
• Australian exports of sheep meat to the European Union are constrained by a relatively small quota of 20,000 tonnes, which it has largely filled in each of the past 5 years. Australian exporters of sheep meat would benefit from improved access to that market given strengthening EU demand for sheep meat and relatively high prices. 
• EU imports of almonds are subject to a low tariff and import demand has been growing steadily. Removal of the tariff on Australian almonds would improve Australia's relative competitiveness but gains are expected to be modest over the medium term given the dominant foothold of the United States in the EU almond market. 
• The effect of Brexit on EU agricultural commodities markets and trade is uncertain at this stage.

            <description type="brief">The report  Australian Farm Survey Results, 2013-14 to 2015-16  reproduces three papers previously published in the March quarter 2016 edition of  Agricultural Commodities: Farm performance: broadacre and dairy farms; Productivity in Australian broadacre and dairy industries; and Disaggregating farm performance statistics by size. The re-packaged papers provide an easy to access publication with ABARES farm surveys results in one location. 

 The analysis in the report is mainly based on data collected in 2015-16 from the  Agricultural and Grazing Industries Survey (AAGIS) and the  Australian Dairy Industry Survey (ADIS). These surveys are funded by the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources, the Grains Research and Development Corporation (GRDC) and Meat and Livestock Australia (MLA). 

 Key issues  
 Farm financial performance  • In 2015-16, ABARES estimates that average farm cash income will increase in New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory. Dry seasonal conditions in Victoria and Tasmania have reduced crop and livestock production resulting in a reduction in projected farm cash incomes. 
• For Australia as a whole, farm cash income of broadacre farms is projected to average $179 000 a farm in 2015-16 - the highest recorded in the past 20 years. 
• The expected increase in farm cash incomes in 2015-16 has been driven by high livestock prices - especially for beef cattle - and good winter grain production in most regions. 
• It is projected that average farm cash income of dairy farms will decline by 26 per cent to an average of $113 000 a farm in 2015-16, reflecting lower farmgate milk prices, reduced production and higher fodder costs. 
 Productivity in Broadacre and dairy industries  • Productivity in the broadacre industries grew by 1.1 per cent a year on average between 1977-78 and 2013-14. Broadacre productivity growth was driven largely by declining input use while maintaining modest output growth. 
• While dairy industry productivity grew by 1.6 per cent a year on average between 1978-79 and 2013-14. This reflects strong output growth (1.3 per cent a year) and some reduction in input use (-0.2 per cent a year). 
 Disaggregating farm performance statistics by size  • The economic performance of farms in 10 size categories is presented. For each size category, the following measures are presented: share of total output produced, total cash receipts, total cash costs, profit at full equity, total opening capital, net capital additions, rate of return, including capital appreciation and equity ratio. 
• The largest 10 per cent of farms produced 48 per cent of all broadacre farm output, while the smallest 50 per cent of farms produced 11 per cent of total broadacre output.

            <description type="brief">These data are derived from returns submitted to the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) by banks authorised under the Banking Act 1959. APRA assumed responsibility for the supervision and regulation of banks on 1 July 1998. Data prior to that date were submitted to the RBA.

Up to and including June 2000, data are averages of weekly (Wednesday) figures. From July 2000, data are for the last business day of every month. Up to and including March 2002, banks submitted Form D (Statement of Liabilities and Assets on the Australian Books). In March 2002, APRA implemented new reporting forms for banks. The data, dating from April 2002, are derived from ARF 320.0 Statement of Financial Position (Domestic Books).

ARF 320.0 covers the domestic books of the licensed bank and is an unconsolidated report of the Australian bank’s operations/transactions that are booked or recorded inside Australia (with Australian residents and non-residents). ARF 320.0 does not consolidate Australian and offshore-controlled entities (thus offshore branches of the Australian bank are excluded). ARF 320.0 includes transactions of Australian-based offshore banking units of the licensed ADI but excludes transactions of overseas-based offshore banking units.

An Australian ‘resident’ is any individual, business or other organisation domiciled in Australia. Australian branches and subsidiaries of foreign businesses are regarded as Australian residents. A ‘non-resident’ is any individual, business or other organisation domiciled overseas. Foreign branches and subsidiaries of Australian businesses are regarded as non-residents.

‘Resident assets – notes and coins, and deposits due from RBA’ includes: Australian and foreign currency notes and coins; settlement account balances with the RBA and any other central bank; and any other funds held at the RBA.

‘Resident assets – bills receivables’ refers to assets arising from undertakings by customers to pay bills of exchange drawn by the banks. From April 2002, this item includes Australian dollar- and foreign currency-denominated (AUD equivalent) bill receivables. Prior to that date, foreign currency-denominated (AUD equivalent) bill receivables are included in ‘resident assets – other assets’.

‘Resident assets – loans and advances – residential’ include: owner-occupied and investment housing loans. ‘Resident assets – loans and advances – personal’ include: revolving credit; credit cards; personal lease financing; and other personal term loans. ‘Resident assets – loans and advances – commercial’ include: loans to community service organisations and non-profit institutions; loans to non-financial corporations; loans to general government; and loans to financial corporations. The loans and advances data are net of specific provisions for bad and doubtful debts, but gross of general provisions for bad and doubtful debts. Loans and advances exclude: bills of exchange, commercial paper, promissory notes, certificates of deposit, and some other debt securities. From April 2002, loans and advances refer to Australian dollar- and foreign currency-denominated (AUD equivalent) loans and advances. Prior to that date, foreign currency-denominated (AUD equivalent) loans and advances are included in ‘resident assets – other assets’.

‘Resident assets – other assets’ refers to all other resident assets not included in the above items. Prior to April 2002, this item includes: shares; bullion; past-due bills; accounts receivable; prepayments made; public sector securities; and all other resident assets other than accrued interest not yet receivable and intangible assets. From April 2002, this item includes: cash and liquid assets other than notes and coins and deposits due from RBA; trading and investment securities; fixed assets; intangible assets; other investments and all other assets not reported above. Note that, from April 2002, this item also includes unrealised gains on trading derivatives – prior to that date, these were excluded.

‘Resident assets – total’ refers to total assets on the Australian books of banks that are due from residents, and is the sum of the above items. ‘Resident assets – of which: denominated in foreign currency’ refers to the Australian dollar equivalent of ‘resident assets – total’ on the Australian books of banks that are denominated in foreign currency.

‘Non-resident assets – total’ refers to total assets on the Australian books of banks that are due from non-residents, though from April 2002, this series excludes the total amount due from banks’ overseas operations, which have been separately identified on the new reporting form. ‘Non-resident assets – of which: denominated in foreign currency’ refers to the Australian dollar equivalent of ‘non-resident assets – total’ on the Australian books of banks that are denominated in foreign currency.

‘Total assets’ is the sum of ‘resident assets – total’ and ‘non-resident assets – total’. From April 2002, this item also includes the ‘amount due from overseas operations’, which is identified separately from ‘resident assets – total’ and ‘non-resident assets – total’. The ‘amount due from overseas operations’ refers to domestic book on-balance sheet assets due from overseas operations of banks which have not been included in the above items.

            <description type="brief">Overview 
 The report provides updated commodity forecasts as well as articles on the EU beef industry, world biofuel policies and the South American wine industry. 

Key Issues 
 Commodity forecasts  
• The gross value of farm production is forecast to increase by 6.1 per cent to around $60.2 billion in 2016-17, following an estimated 4.2 per cent increase to $56.7 billion in 2015-16. At this forecast level the gross value of farm production in 2016-17 would be around 16 per cent higher than the average of $52 billion over the five years to 2015-16 in nominal terms. 
• The gross value of livestock production is forecast to decrease by 2.2 per cent to $28.5 billion in 2016-17, following an estimated 7.7 per cent increase in 2015-16. 
• The gross value of crop production is forecast to increase by 14.7 per cent to $31.7 billion in 2016-17. This reflects forecast increases in the gross value of horticulture and cotton production. 
• Export earnings from farm commodities are forecast to increase by 6.7 per cent to $47.5 billion in 2016-17, following an estimated 1.4 per cent increase in 2015-16 to $44.6 billion. 
• The agricultural commodities for which export earnings are forecast to rise in 2016-17 are wheat (up 25 per cent), wool (3 per cent), sugar (23 per cent), wine (3 per cent), barley (15 per cent), cotton (56 per cent), chickpeas (74 per cent), lamb (4 per cent), canola (33 per cent) and rock lobster (6 per cent). 
• The forecast increases in export earnings are expected to be partly offset by forecast falls in beef and veal (down 17 per cent), live feeder/slaughter cattle (17 per cent) and mutton (12 per cent). Export earnings for dairy products are expected to remain largely unchanged. 
• Export earnings for fisheries products are forecast to increase by 3.4 per cent to $1.6 billion in 2016-17, after increasing by an estimated 7.1 per cent in 2015-16. 

 Economic assumptions underlying this set of commodity forecasts  

 In preparing this set of agricultural commodity forecasts: • World economic growth is assumed to be 2.9 per cent in 2016 and 3.3 per cent in 2017. 
• Economic growth in Australia is assumed to average 2.5 per cent in 2016-17. 
• The Australian dollar is assumed to average US75 cents in 2016-17, slightly higher than the average of US73 cents in 2015-16. 

 Articles on agricultural issues  

 The EU beef industry  
• The European Union is one of the world's largest consumers and importers of beef. Access to the EU market is controlled by strict animal health requirements and various quotas, which limit the amount of beef that can be imported. 
• As the European Union is a high value market for beef, improved access for Australia from a free trade agreement would likely lead to increased exports to this market. 

 Oils ain't oils  
• Biofuel policies in some of the world's largest biofuel producing economies have the potential to affect returns to Australian agricultural exports such as canola, sugar and coarse grains. 
• This article looks at recent developments in the world's leading biofuel producers and consumers (the United States, European Union and Brazil) and discusses the expected impact on world commodity prices in 2016-17 and the high-level implications for agricultural commodities in the medium term. 
 South American wine industry  
• South America is a major world producer and exporter of wine, accounting for almost 14 per cent of world production. Wine exports from South America have increased markedly in the past 15 years and its wine increasingly competes in Australia's major and emerging export markets. 
• This article focuses on the development of the Argentine and Chilean wine industries, with a focus on their competitiveness with Australian wine exports.

            <description type="brief">Overview  

 This study examines the effect of climate variability and climate change on the productivity of Australian cropping farms between 1977-78 and 2014-15. This study combines ABARES farm survey data with spatial climate data to estimate the effect of climate conditions (such as, rainfall and temperature) on cropping farm productivity. The study then presents climate-adjusted productivity estimates with the effects of climate removed. For comparison, similar results are generated for farm wheat yields using the same data sources and methods. 

 Key Issues  
• After removing the effects of climate, a clearer picture of underlying trends in farm productivity emerges. A slowdown in productivity growth is apparent during the 1990s, with productivity growth of 2.1 per cent per year between 1977-78 and 1993-94, and just 0.2 per cent per year between 1993-94 and 2006-07. However, there is evidence of a significant rebound in climate-adjusted productivity since 2006-07, with annual growth of 1.5 per cent per year. 
• During the past 20 years, large changes in Australia's climate have been observed, including reductions in average winter rainfall in southern Australia and general increases in temperature. The recent changes in climate have had a significant negative effect on the productivity of Australian cropping farms, particularly in south-western Australia and south-eastern Australia. 
• Although climate conditions for cropping have declined overall, some regions have been relatively unaffected or even experienced slight improvements since 2000-01, including the coastal high-rainfall zones of southern Australia, and parts of northern New South Wales and Queensland. In general, larger negative effects have occurred in lower-rainfall inland parts of the cropping zone (given these areas are more sensitive to rainfall decline). 
• Strong growth in productivity since 2006-07 has helped the cropping industry to offset the decline in climate conditions. Further, the results suggest that these recent productivity improvements reflect adaptation to the changing climate. 
• The results suggest that farmers have adapted to the longer-term changes in climate by focusing on technologies and management practices that improve productivity during dry years. Anecdotal information suggests that farmers have made a variety of management practice changes-including adoption of conservation tillage-to better exploit summer soil moisture, as an adaptation to reduced winter rainfall. 
• There is also evidence of shifts in the location of cropping activity over time. Both ABARES and ABS data shows that the amount of cropping activity in higher-rainfall zones-such as south-western Victoria-has increased in recent decades. At the same time, there is evidence that cropping activity has decreased in some inland areas that have been heavily affected by the deteriorating climate.

            <description type="brief">Weathering, erosion and depositional historyThe Mt Isa region is characterised by a complex history of weathering and landscape development. Following marine incursion, Mesozoic sediments were deposited on a landsurface of significant relief. Thus, Cretaceous sandstone, shale, claystone, siltstone, limestone, and conglomerate at that time overlay most of the Mt Isa Inlier and since has been partly eroded. Subsequent regional uplift and drainage incision has led to the development of the broad features of the present landscape, in which extensive plains surround a central hill zone. Some of the plains have been further modified by the deposition of Tertiary sediments.Long periods of stability have favoured the development of a deep, weathered mantle, which has been differentially eroded during more active phases of erosion. Ferruginous or siliceous duricrusts can occur in the upper parts of weathered profiles. Where relatively fresh rock is exposed in erosional terrains, these are partly mantled by calcareous soils.Regional regolith distribution and geomorphic provincesAs an aid to geochemical dispersion studies, a regolith-landform framework was established for the Mt Isa region. Mapping of an area of 84,000 km2 (17 degrees 30'S - 22 degrees 00'S; 137 degrees 30'E - 141 degrees OO'E) at a scale of 1:500,000, has shown the broad distribution of ferruginous materials, silcretes, soils, saprolite, Proterozoic bedrock Mesozoic sediments, colluvial-alluvial and lacustrine sediments. In the mapped area, Mesozoic sediments are more widespread in the southeast and to the north than in the centre of the Mt Isa Inlier. Lateritic duricrusts are more common in the Western Succession than in the Eastern Succession. Large areas of alluvial deposits occur west and east of the Mt Isa Inlier. Narrow corridors of coarse alluvium trend northeast across the Inlier and small areas of coarse colluvium cover the footslopes of steep hills.In the present study, three broad geomorphic subdivisions are recognised, namely hill belts, a complex of mesas and plains, and plains. These show varying degrees of weathering, erosion and deposition and are developed on Proterozoic bedrock and Mesozoic sediments. The three major provinces were further subdivided on the basis of their dominant geology and topography.The hill belts occupy the central portion of the region and consist predominantly of north-trending ridges and hills. Here, the detailed sculpturing of the landsurface is intimately related to differential weathering and erosion of various lithologies. Mesozoic sediments are sporadically distributed generally capping small mesas. Not all the rocks in the hill belts are fresh and many have signs of former and present weathering that involves formation of kaolinite, smectite and pedogenic carbonates. Zones of superficial, secondary silicification are marked. The colluvium is generally less than one metre thick but reaches thickness of 12 m in places. Soils developed in colluvium are calcareous to non-calcareous.The terrain characterised by a complex of mesas and plains indicates the variable distribution of former lateritic weathering. These areas are interpreted as a dissected plateau on which the original old surface forms a significant component of the landscape. This terrain occupies part of the Western and Eastern Successions. Deeply weathered profiles, with ferruginous or siliceous cappings, occur on stable parts of the landscape (mesa crests) but, even here, the total depth of weathering is variable. In contrast, relatively shallow weathering profiles occur on pediments and erosional plains. The depositional plains are mantled with shallow alluvium (1-5 m) which are underlain by deeply weathered profiles with or without a ferruginous or siliceous cappingThe plains feature variable thicknesses of weathered and partly eroded Cainozoic, Tertiary and Mesozoic sediments, underlain by Proterozoic bedrock.Weathering profilesThe nature and depth of weathering profiles on Proterozoic and Mesozoic rocks are variable and are largely controlled by bedrock composition and palaeo-topography. However, the depth of weathering of the Proterozoic rocks is also controlled by the presence (or absence) of overlying Mesozoic sediments at the time of weathering. Proterozoic rocks are weathered to greater depths where Mesozoic sediments have been removed or were never deposited. Lateritic duricrust and indurated ferruginous saprolite were developed on ferruginous lithologies, with silcrete and silicified saprolite in equivalent situations on siliceous bedrock.The 'complete' weathering profile, from top to base, has a lag of lateritic nodules and pisoliths, pockets of duricrust, indurated ferruginous saprolite, a clay zone, saprolite (silicified in part), saprock and bedrock. Lateritic duricrust and silcrete have also developed on some Mesozoic sediments. Mottled zones are common on Tertiary sediments.The characteristics of weathering profiles reflect both past and present weathering conditions. The ferruginous and siliceous duricrust-capped weathering profiles, containing Al203, Fe203 and, probably, SiO2 corresponds to wet climates, whereas calcrete and smectite are products of arid conditions. Calcrete and smectite are typically developed on partially weathered rocks of hill belts and on erosional plains, and are products of weathering under the present climate. Duricrust-capped, deeply weathered, kaolinised profiles on mesas are inherited from past climates.SoilsSoils have formed on sediments (Mesozoic and Cainozoic), Proterozoic bedrock and on saprolites formed from these bedrocks. Lateritic, gravely soils have developed on lateritic profiles of the plateau erosion surface on Proterozoic and Mesozoic sediments. Red, brown and yellow earths occur on slopes and plains in erosional terrain developed below the lateritic plateau remnants. They are formed on the underlying saprolite and saprock. Yellow earths are generally associated with more siliceous Proterozoic bedrocks but, on the more ferruginous rocks, red earths occur. In places, however, these residual soils are overlain by recent fluvial deposits.Lithosols or skeletal soils are associated with resistant rocks and areas of high relief and steeper slopes. Soils of the hill belts contain abundant pedogenic carbonates from recent weathering of underlying rocks.In depositional plains, the soils vary from black through red to grey sandy clay, sands or clays and generally contain polymictic gravels. The nature of the soil depends on the provenance and thickness of the parent materials and on the history of post-depositional erosion. Brown and red soils are developed where the drainage is good. Hydromorphic conditions in depressions and gentle slopes favour formation of black soils. Some soils are cemented by Fe oxides and others by silica.Ferruginous materialsThese are six main categories of ferruginous materials in the Mt Isa region. These include lateritic gravels (mottles, nodules and pisoliths), lateritic duricrusts, ferricretes, indurated ferruginous saprolite, ferruginous bands and ferruginous veins; the origins of these materials vary. Mottles and nodules are residual; pisoliths have experienced local transport. The Fe-rich composition in lateritic duricrusts is the result of either or both of two processes: (1) relative concentration of Fe and Al by removal of Si and bases and landscape lowering; (2) concentration of these elements by absolute accumulation from outside sources. Duricrusts, (e.g., slabby duricrust) formed by laterally accumulated Fe were originally formed in locally derived substrates in valleys and the topography has since been inverted. Ferricretes are formed by the Fe enrichment of sediments and are not genetically related to the underlying lithologies. Where the bedrock is rich in Fe, pseudomorphic replacement of kaolinite by Fe oxides has led to strongly indurated hematite-/goethite-rich ferruginous saprolite. Ferruginous bands occur in the lower and middle part of the profile and appear related to fluctuations in the water table and texture of sediments. Ferruginous veins follow bedding planes and fault systems.Ferruginous materials in the Mt Isa region have formed in a variety of substrates derived from Proterozoic bedrock, Mesozoic, Tertiary and recent sediments. However, the degree of development of the ferruginous horizon depends upon the nature of the parent material. The ferruginous horizon on Tertiary sediments is limited to mottles; duricrust is not developed.SilcreteSilicification has affected a range of regolith materials. Well-developed silcretes on plateau remnants are interpreted as a landscape near equivalent of the lateritic duricrust. Silcrete is not only developed on bedrock but is also developed in alluvium, sand and gravel sediments of valleys, many of which have since undergone topographic inversion.Erosional surfacesNo reliable indication of age can be obtained from the morphology, chemistry and mineralogy of duricrusts as similar ranges of weathering and ferruginous and siliceous duricrusts occur at different levels. Variation in altitude of duricrusts may result from differential erosion of a single, broadly undulating, deeply weathered landsurface and to variations in local geology and groundwater conditions. The variable Fe oxide mineralogy of lateritic duricrusts suggests that they have formed in differing hydrological environments. Duricrusts dominated by hematite may be older than those dominated by goethite. The variety of ferruginous and siliceous materials suggests that formation of landsurfaces in the Mt Isa region has been complex. It would be unwise to ascribe a single age to the regolith or imply a single extensive surface of planation, since different parts of the surface may have formed at different times.Pilot studiesFive pilot studies of areas characterised by base metal geochemical anomalies (Python, Lady Loretta, Drifter, Blinder, Tringadee) are summarised within their district-scale regolith-landform settings. Common regolith-landform situations and their implications to exploration, particularly in relation to geochemical sampling media and data interpretation, are discussed.The Python Cu Prospect (Buckley River-Grey Ghost district) has a Cu. Sb, As and Pb anomaly restricted to slabby duricrust and lateritic nodules and pisoliths. There are three sources of Fe and trace elements at the Python Prospect, namely pyritic units in the Proterozoic bedrock a fault that cuts through the duricrust -capped hill and absolute accumulation from outside sources. The fault is rich in Pb, Au and Sb and is probably related to underlying mineralisation. Dispersion from the fault has caused a broad anomaly in the slabby duricrusts and lateritic nodules and pisoliths.At the Lady Loretta Deposit, patchily developed nodular duricrust is widely enriched in As, Sb, Mo, W. Pb and Zn and is related to underlying Pb-Zn-Ag mineralisation. The duricrusts are located on a mesa which is strongly dissected. This confirms that analysis of even widely-spaced duricrust may reveal base metal mineralisation below a deeply weathered lateritic surface.A cherty breccia (Cambrian unconformity) and soils at the Drifter Prospect are anomalous in Cu. Zn and Pb without any known underlying significant mineralisation. Copper and Zn anomalies in the cherty breccia appear to be related to leakage from the Proterozoic Drifter Fault into the overlying Cambrian. These elements exhibit similar dispersion characteristics and have strong affinities for Fe and Mn oxides, implying hydromorphic dispersion. Iron in the cherty breccia is derived from several sources, including the fault and the underlying Proterozoic bedrock. The high concentrations of Pb and Sb in soils imply a nearby source, since Pb and Sb are relatively immobile. However, the source may be minor.At the Blinder Prospect there are significant Zn and Pb anomalies in the Mt Hendry Formation but no mineralisation has been found by drilling. The Fe oxides that host the anomaly in conglomerate (Mt Hendry Formation) are not derived from the underlying Paradise Creek Formation or from the overlying Cambrian. Bedding in the Mt Hendry Formation suggests a fluvial environment that has transported the anomalous Fe-rich material into place before burial by the Cambrian.At the Tringadee Prospect there is a widespread Zn anomaly in the Mesozoic cover. The Zn anomaly is associated with accumulated Fe and Mn oxides, probably related to fluctuating water tables and fractures in the Mesozoic cover. The latter appear to have conducted Fe-rich fluids from external sources. The source of these anomalies could be nearby deposits such as Cannington and Pegmont.Regolith-landform mappingApplication of an interpretive or derivative mapping scheme established for parts of the Yilgarn Craton (colloquially referred to as the "RED mapping scheme") is assessed for the Mt Isa region. An interpretative scheme for the Mt Isa region is proposed. This is now open for comment and other interpretative schemes are being considered.</description>

Public Summary
DNA based approaches will be used to study key features of the ecology of whales, penguins and krill. Standard methods cannot accurately estimate what prey species these predators consume, how old they are, or how they are related to the rest of their species. This project will apply novel DNA based methods to biopsy or scat samples as a non-invasive means of improving our understanding of the diet, age and population structure of these important predators.

Project objectives:

The overall objective of this project is to use molecular biology to study aspects of the ecology of key Southern Ocean predators that cannot be addressed with other methodologies. The organisms that the project would focus upon have been chosen because they are large biomass components of the Southern Ocean food web and because they are important to the Australian Governments commitments to the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) and the International Whaling Commission (IWC). This project is integral to the work of the Australian Centre for Applied Marine Mammal Science (ACAMMS) that has recently been formed within the Science Branch of the AAD. The focus predators are baleen whales (primarily Minke whales, Balaenoptera edeni and Humpback whales, Megaptera novaengliae), Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) and Adelie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae). Within this overall goal, there are three major objectives:

1. To characterise and monitor predation by key Southern Ocean organisms with dietary DNA analysis. 
2. To use population genetics to study the stock structure and population size of baleen whales and Antarctic krill.
3. To develop and validate DNA-based age estimation methods for whales.

1. DNA Based Dietary Research
A major objective of this project is to apply DNA based methods for dietary analysis to large sample sets taken to address specific ecological questions. My group at the Australian Antarctic Division has been at the forefront of developing DNA based methods to study animal diet. We have been especially active in researching DNA as a non-invasive means of studying the diet of large mammals and birds by reconstructing diet with prey DNA that we can identify in scats from predators. Our development of new DNA-based methodologies (Jarman et al., 2002; Jarman et al., 2004; Deagle et al., 2005; Jarman et al., 2006a) and accompanying software tools (Jarman 2004; Jarman 2006) have led to more efficient dietary analysis methods and has produced a substantial volume of good quality published research and stimulated international interest in these methodologies, which are now being pursued by several overseas laboratories. We have completed short descriptive studies of the diet of Antarctic krill (Passmore et al., 2006), whales (Jarman et al., 2002; Jarman et al., 2004; Jarman et al., 2006b), fur seals (Casper et al., in prep) and macaroni penguins (Deagle et al., in prep) with these methods, but have not had comprehensive sets of samples with which we can address broader ecological questions. The ecological questions that the dietary component of this project will address are:

1a. What is the diversity and identity of prey species consumed by populations of the key predators?
1b. What are the relative biomass proportions of prey species consumed by key predator populations?
1c. What temporal variation is there in diversity, identity and abundance of prey consumed by each key predator population?
1d. What spatial variation is there in diversity, identity and abundance of prey consumed by each key predator population?

The focus species cover three trophic levels of the Southern Ocean food web. Krill are thought to feed predominately on primary producers with some heterotrophic prey taken as well. Adelie penguins feed on krill and other small nekton and plankton, as well as being prey of leopard seals and killer whales, making them a mid-to-high level predator. Baleen whales feed on diverse planktonic and nektonic organisms, preferring crustaceans and small fish that tend to form high-concentration swarms and are top predators. By studying krill and their most abundant predators (Adelie penguins) and their largest predators (baleen whales) we get an assessment of trophic flow from primary production to both a mid-level predator and a top-level predator. It is clearly not possible to study all components of the Southern Ocean food web, so by targeting these three key groups it is hoped that we will not only gather information that is most directly relevant to the objectives of the science program, but that this information will also be an efficient means of assaying some of the most important trophic interactions in the Southern Ocean food web as a whole.

Krill are highly abundant and quite easy to sample. They are generalist feeders, which makes them a good organism for monitoring changes in populations of primary producers and small heterotrophs. Furthermore, they are the target organism of the world's largest crustacean fishery (Nicol and Endo, 1997). This makes them a species of major interest to CCAMLR. Our scientific objective in studying krill diet with DNA based methods is to improve our understanding of this critically important organism. This research should contribute to Australia's role in CCAMLR and consequent influence within the Antarctic treaty system. 

Adelie penguins are the only land-based predators in this study. They are the most abundant penguin and can be found in high concentrations at breeding colonies at many points along the Antarctic coastline. This makes their population size and condition relatively easy to estimate when compared to completely marine organisms. These features make them an excellent animal to survey for ecosystem monitoring purposes and they have been selected by CCAMLR as their main organism for the CEMP (CCAMLR Ecosystem Monitoring Program). The objective of the Adelie penguin DNA based diet research is to develop non-invasive diet analysis methods that can rapidly and cheaply analyse large numbers of scat samples for prey DNA. This technology would allow us to monitor penguin diet without stomach flushing and would also enable the generation of much finer-scale temporal and spatial information on Adelie penguin diet. It is hoped that the development of these methods to the point where they become practical and cheap to apply on a large scale may eventually allow them to be recommended to CEMP as a replacement for stomach flushing as a dietary analysis method.

Baleen whales are highly visible components of the Southern Ocean ecosystem and despite their relative scarcity, they are very well studied because of their charisma and being the focus of a prominent international fishery and conservation organisation, the IWC. The diet of baleen whales is difficult to study with any methodology, so our previous development of DNA based methods to analyse prey DNA found in whale scats as part of AAS project 2301 was scientifically quite a useful advance. It was also a useful political advance for Australia as we can now argue that lethal whaling for 'scientific' studies is less necessary than previously claimed. The objective of the baleen whale diet work is to continue our previous research in this area to maintain our position as the only country within the IWC that is capable of doing truly non-invasive dietary research on whales.

2. Population Genetics Research
This project would also include studies of the population genetics of humpback whales, minke whales and Antarctic krill. These studies have two goals. The first is to study genetic differentiation within each of these species. For humpback whales this work would focus on attempts to link whales found in Australian Antarctic waters during the summer feeding season with the whales that migrate past the west and east coasts of Australia and which breed near south Pacific islands. For Antarctic krill, the genetic differentiation work aims to identify genetic 'stocks' of krill to assist in policy decisions for managing the krill fishery, as well as potentially providing a tool for measuring flux of krill between different regions of the Southern Ocean.

The second goal of the population genetics work is to use genetic data to estimate population size. Simple methods for estimating the size of an animal breeding population (the 'effective population') have been available for some time. We would apply these methods and also work on newer genetic 'mark and recapture' type methods that estimate overall population size, rather than just the size of the proportion of the population that reproduces. Another aspect of this goal is the estimation of past population sizes, which would give us a better idea of pre-exploitation stocks of whales and their relative recovery from exploitation to date.

3. DNA-Based Age Estimation
Another major goal of the project is to develop genetic methods for estimating the age of whales. This would be a major advance for cetacean science as the methods could be performed on DNA collected through biopsy samples, or potentially even from the 'sloughed' skin that a whale leaves behind when diving. There are currently no validated, non-lethal methods for estimating cetacean age in adults. The only alternative methods for age estimation involve lethal sampling for collection of ear bones in which growth rings can be counted. One of the main claims promulgated by the Japanese scientific whaling program is that lethal sampling of whales is necessary for aging them. The political objective of this research would be to neutralise this claim in the same way that our DNA based dietary research has previously neutralised the claim that lethal sampling is necessary for dietary analysis. Alongside this political objective is the scientific objective that the development of a widely applicable, non-lethal aging method for whales would provide a wealth of information on the age structure of whale populations. This is an especially important feature of their ecology as most of the great whales are still recovering from human exploitation, which should have led to skewed age distributions in these populations when compared to the natural age distribution. Better knowledge of their population age structure will greatly improve our understanding of the recovery process and the current status of whale populations.

Taken from the 2009-2010 Progress Report:

Progress against objectives:

1. DNA based diet work. We converted our DNA based diet analysis work to next-generation sequencing based methodologies and refined blocking primer approaches for eliminating predator DNA in the libraries that we sequence. This approach was published as Deagle et al (2009) as listed in the papers below.
2. Population genetics research. A microsatellite and mitochondrial sequence dataset for humpback whale population samples in eastern Australian waters, West Australian waters and Antarctic waters in the Ross Sea has been generated, analysed and a paper written.
3. DNA based age estimation. Libraries of cDNA from juvenile, sub Adult and Adult humpback whales have been analysed. ~1.2 gb data was produced for each library. We are currently analysing these to identify genes that are differentially expressed among the three age classes.</description>

      Variations to work plan or objectives:
      No work is planned for the Casey region anymore due to logistical difficulties accessing the region.
      
      Field work:
      Field work was carried out at three locations that provided samples for this project:
      
      1. Evans Head, northern NSW. 63 biopsies from humpback whales were taken.
      2. The northern Ross Sea / Balleny Island region. ~ 60 biopsy samples were collected from humpback whales.
      3. Macquarie Island - 1150 samples of scats collected for diverse predator species.
      
      Laboratory activity/analysis:
      The majority of our work is lab based. These activities have progressed very well. The Macquarie Island samples should be processed and analysed by the end of 2010 as will the humpback whale transcriptome analyses.</description>

Public Summary
DNA based approaches will be used to study key features of the ecology of whales, penguins and krill. Standard methods cannot accurately estimate what prey species these predators consume, how old they are, or how they are related to the rest of their species. This project will apply novel DNA based methods to biopsy or scat samples as a non-invasive means of improving our understanding of the diet, age and population structure of these important predators.

Project objectives:

The overall objective of this project is to use molecular biology to study aspects of the ecology of key Southern Ocean predators that cannot be addressed with other methodologies. The organisms that the project would focus upon have been chosen because they are large biomass components of the Southern Ocean food web and because they are important to the Australian Governments commitments to the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) and the International Whaling Commission (IWC). This project is integral to the work of the Australian Centre for Applied Marine Mammal Science (ACAMMS) that has recently been formed within the Science Branch of the AAD. The focus predators are baleen whales (primarily Minke whales, Balaenoptera edeni and Humpback whales, Megaptera novaengliae), Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) and Adelie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae). Within this overall goal, there are three major objectives:

1. To characterise and monitor predation by key Southern Ocean organisms with dietary DNA analysis. 
2. To use population genetics to study the stock structure and population size of baleen whales and Antarctic krill.
3. To develop and validate DNA-based age estimation methods for whales.

1. DNA Based Dietary Research
A major objective of this project is to apply DNA based methods for dietary analysis to large sample sets taken to address specific ecological questions. My group at the Australian Antarctic Division has been at the forefront of developing DNA based methods to study animal diet. We have been especially active in researching DNA as a non-invasive means of studying the diet of large mammals and birds by reconstructing diet with prey DNA that we can identify in scats from predators. Our development of new DNA-based methodologies (Jarman et al., 2002; Jarman et al., 2004; Deagle et al., 2005; Jarman et al., 2006a) and accompanying software tools (Jarman 2004; Jarman 2006) have led to more efficient dietary analysis methods and has produced a substantial volume of good quality published research and stimulated international interest in these methodologies, which are now being pursued by several overseas laboratories. We have completed short descriptive studies of the diet of Antarctic krill (Passmore et al., 2006), whales (Jarman et al., 2002; Jarman et al., 2004; Jarman et al., 2006b), fur seals (Casper et al., in prep) and macaroni penguins (Deagle et al., in prep) with these methods, but have not had comprehensive sets of samples with which we can address broader ecological questions. The ecological questions that the dietary component of this project will address are:

1a. What is the diversity and identity of prey species consumed by populations of the key predators?
1b. What are the relative biomass proportions of prey species consumed by key predator populations?
1c. What temporal variation is there in diversity, identity and abundance of prey consumed by each key predator population?
1d. What spatial variation is there in diversity, identity and abundance of prey consumed by each key predator population?

The focus species cover three trophic levels of the Southern Ocean food web. Krill are thought to feed predominately on primary producers with some heterotrophic prey taken as well. Adelie penguins feed on krill and other small nekton and plankton, as well as being prey of leopard seals and killer whales, making them a mid-to-high level predator. Baleen whales feed on diverse planktonic and nektonic organisms, preferring crustaceans and small fish that tend to form high-concentration swarms and are top predators. By studying krill and their most abundant predators (Adelie penguins) and their largest predators (baleen whales) we get an assessment of trophic flow from primary production to both a mid-level predator and a top-level predator. It is clearly not possible to study all components of the Southern Ocean food web, so by targeting these three key groups it is hoped that we will not only gather information that is most directly relevant to the objectives of the science program, but that this information will also be an efficient means of assaying some of the most important trophic interactions in the Southern Ocean food web as a whole.

Krill are highly abundant and quite easy to sample. They are generalist feeders, which makes them a good organism for monitoring changes in populations of primary producers and small heterotrophs. Furthermore, they are the target organism of the world's largest crustacean fishery (Nicol and Endo, 1997). This makes them a species of major interest to CCAMLR. Our scientific objective in studying krill diet with DNA based methods is to improve our understanding of this critically important organism. This research should contribute to Australia's role in CCAMLR and consequent influence within the Antarctic treaty system. 

Adelie penguins are the only land-based predators in this study. They are the most abundant penguin and can be found in high concentrations at breeding colonies at many points along the Antarctic coastline. This makes their population size and condition relatively easy to estimate when compared to completely marine organisms. These features make them an excellent animal to survey for ecosystem monitoring purposes and they have been selected by CCAMLR as their main organism for the CEMP (CCAMLR Ecosystem Monitoring Program). The objective of the Adelie penguin DNA based diet research is to develop non-invasive diet analysis methods that can rapidly and cheaply analyse large numbers of scat samples for prey DNA. This technology would allow us to monitor penguin diet without stomach flushing and would also enable the generation of much finer-scale temporal and spatial information on Adelie penguin diet. It is hoped that the development of these methods to the point where they become practical and cheap to apply on a large scale may eventually allow them to be recommended to CEMP as a replacement for stomach flushing as a dietary analysis method.

Baleen whales are highly visible components of the Southern Ocean ecosystem and despite their relative scarcity, they are very well studied because of their charisma and being the focus of a prominent international fishery and conservation organisation, the IWC. The diet of baleen whales is difficult to study with any methodology, so our previous development of DNA based methods to analyse prey DNA found in whale scats as part of AAS project 2301 was scientifically quite a useful advance. It was also a useful political advance for Australia as we can now argue that lethal whaling for 'scientific' studies is less necessary than previously claimed. The objective of the baleen whale diet work is to continue our previous research in this area to maintain our position as the only country within the IWC that is capable of doing truly non-invasive dietary research on whales.

2. Population Genetics Research
This project would also include studies of the population genetics of humpback whales, minke whales and Antarctic krill. These studies have two goals. The first is to study genetic differentiation within each of these species. For humpback whales this work would focus on attempts to link whales found in Australian Antarctic waters during the summer feeding season with the whales that migrate past the west and east coasts of Australia and which breed near south Pacific islands. For Antarctic krill, the genetic differentiation work aims to identify genetic 'stocks' of krill to assist in policy decisions for managing the krill fishery, as well as potentially providing a tool for measuring flux of krill between different regions of the Southern Ocean.

The second goal of the population genetics work is to use genetic data to estimate population size. Simple methods for estimating the size of an animal breeding population (the 'effective population') have been available for some time. We would apply these methods and also work on newer genetic 'mark and recapture' type methods that estimate overall population size, rather than just the size of the proportion of the population that reproduces. Another aspect of this goal is the estimation of past population sizes, which would give us a better idea of pre-exploitation stocks of whales and their relative recovery from exploitation to date.

3. DNA-Based Age Estimation
Another major goal of the project is to develop genetic methods for estimating the age of whales. This would be a major advance for cetacean science as the methods could be performed on DNA collected through biopsy samples, or potentially even from the 'sloughed' skin that a whale leaves behind when diving. There are currently no validated, non-lethal methods for estimating cetacean age in adults. The only alternative methods for age estimation involve lethal sampling for collection of ear bones in which growth rings can be counted. One of the main claims promulgated by the Japanese scientific whaling program is that lethal sampling of whales is necessary for aging them. The political objective of this research would be to neutralise this claim in the same way that our DNA based dietary research has previously neutralised the claim that lethal sampling is necessary for dietary analysis. Alongside this political objective is the scientific objective that the development of a widely applicable, non-lethal aging method for whales would provide a wealth of information on the age structure of whale populations. This is an especially important feature of their ecology as most of the great whales are still recovering from human exploitation, which should have led to skewed age distributions in these populations when compared to the natural age distribution. Better knowledge of their population age structure will greatly improve our understanding of the recovery process and the current status of whale populations.

Taken from the 2009-2010 Progress Report:

Progress against objectives:

1. DNA based diet work. We converted our DNA based diet analysis work to next-generation sequencing based methodologies and refined blocking primer approaches for eliminating predator DNA in the libraries that we sequence. This approach was published as Deagle et al (2009) as listed in the papers below.
2. Population genetics research. A microsatellite and mitochondrial sequence dataset for humpback whale population samples in eastern Australian waters, West Australian waters and Antarctic waters in the Ross Sea has been generated, analysed and a paper written.
3. DNA based age estimation. Libraries of cDNA from juvenile, sub Adult and Adult humpback whales have been analysed. ~1.2 gb data was produced for each library. We are currently analysing these to identify genes that are differentially expressed among the three age classes.</description>

The dates of the synodic and sidereal rhythms are for the periods of the coral spawning data recorded at Kochi, Japan in 2006-2009 (Nozawa (2012)) and at Lizard Island, Great Barrier Reef, Australia in 1999-2001 (Wolstenholme (2004)), and the atmospheric pressure data (2000-2016). The synodic lunar rhythm data is downloaded from the United States Naval Observatory (USNO) website. Dates of the third (last) quarter moons are listed for the coral spawning data. Dates of the full moons are listed for the atmospheric pressure data. The sidereal lunar rhythm data was downloaded from the web-based interface to JPL&amp;apos;s HORIZONS system using the following settings: Ephemeris Type: Observer; Target Body: Moon [Luna] [301]; Table Settings: Quantities=1, CSV format=Yes, Display/Output: download/save (plain text file). The Observer Location was user defined as Kochi: 132deg43&amp;#8217;57.0&amp;#8221;E, 32deg46&amp;#8217;44.0&amp;#8221;N and Lizard Island: 145deg27&amp;#8217;37.4&amp;#8221;E, 14deg40&amp;#8217;05.5&amp;#8221;S. The sidereal data records the dates of zero declinations i.e. when the moon passes over the equator as it moves from the northern to the southern hemisphere (changes from a + to &amp;#8211; value) and the southern to the northern hemisphere (changes from a &amp;#8211; to + value). The atmospheric pressure and wind speed data for Kochi was downloaded from the Japan Meteorological Agency website (in Japanese) for the location of Shimizu, grouped by mean daily average. The atmospheric pressure and wind speed data for Lizard Island was downloaded from the Australian Institute of Marine Science Historic Data Tool for the location of Agincourt Reef Number 3, grouped by mean daily average with rule-based quality control applied.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

            <description type="brief">This dataset consists of 43 thermal ionisation mass spectrometry (TIMS) U-Th dates from living Porites spp. of known ages collected from the far northern, central and southern inshore regions of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) which were used to spatially constrain initial 230Th/232Th (230Th/232Th0) variability.
Such information is essential in providing accurate chronologies used to pinpoint changes in coral community structure and the timing of mortality events in recent time (e.g. since European settlement of northern Australia in the 1850’s).


Methods:

Study area:
Massive Porites coral cores and whole live colonies were sampled from three distinct regions of the GBR that have been subject to varying degrees of land modification in nearby catchment areas. The regions sampled included: far northern GBR, central GBR, southern GBR. Subsamples from each colony were subsequently used to determine the spatial variation of 230Th0.
Sample preparation:
A total of 11 modern Porites samples were sectioned down the main growth axis and a 7mm thick slice prepared. X-rays of each slab were taken at the University of Queensland Veterinary Clinic. Once annual banding patterns were well constrained in modern Porites samples, a 1-2g sample was drilled from within a single growth band using a bench drill with a 5 mm drill bit. This was repeated three to four times along the length of the colony for different annual growth bands. All samples were then ultrasonically cleaned in deionised water 3-4 times until no visible contaminants were evident and dried at 40°C on a hot-plate under contamination-free conditions (Shen et al., 2008).
U-series chemistry and analytical procedures:
Forty-three sub-samples from 11 living Porites coral colonies were prepared for U-Th dating using a VG-Sector-54 WARP-filtered high-abundance-sensitivity thermal ionisation mass spectrometer (TIMS) at the Radiogenic Isotope Facility (RIF), University of Queensland, following the analytical protocol described in detail in Zhao et al. (2001; 2009b) and Yu et al. (2006).

Initial 230Th/232Th calculation:
Previous studies have used living corals to resolve 230Th0 by calculating the value required to account for the difference between the ‘true age’ of the coral determined by annual band counting versus the actual U-series age (Cobb et al., 2003b; Yu et al., 2006; McCulloch and Mortimer, 2008; Burgess et al., 2009). Similarly in this study, 230Th/232Th0 values were calculated for live coral samples using the absolute band-counting ages of the corals obtained from X-ray images and the modified U-series age equation for young samples (&amp;lt;1000 years old) described by Zhao et al. (2009b).


Format of the data:

The dataset comprises of U-Th data obtained using thermal ionisation mass spectrometry (TIMS). Data is presented in a table in an excel spreadsheet with values for sample weight (g), U concentration (ppm), 232Th concentration (ppb), measured 230Th/232Th (activity ratio), 230Th/238U (activity ratio), ?234U (activity ratio), uncorrected 230Th age (in years), time of chemistry (years AD), growth band age (years AD), initial 230Th/232Th (atomic ratio), initial 230Th/232Th (activity ratio).

            <description type="brief">This dataset consists of 43 thermal ionisation mass spectrometry (TIMS) U-Th dates from living Porites spp. of known ages collected from the far northern, central and southern inshore regions of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) which were used to spatially constrain initial 230Th/232Th (230Th/232Th0) variability.
Such information is essential in providing accurate chronologies used to pinpoint changes in coral community structure and the timing of mortality events in recent time (e.g. since European settlement of northern Australia in the 1850’s).


Methods:

Study area:
Massive Porites coral cores and whole live colonies were sampled from three distinct regions of the GBR that have been subject to varying degrees of land modification in nearby catchment areas. The regions sampled included: far northern GBR, central GBR, southern GBR. Subsamples from each colony were subsequently used to determine the spatial variation of 230Th0.
Sample preparation:
A total of 11 modern Porites samples were sectioned down the main growth axis and a 7mm thick slice prepared. X-rays of each slab were taken at the University of Queensland Veterinary Clinic. Once annual banding patterns were well constrained in modern Porites samples, a 1-2g sample was drilled from within a single growth band using a bench drill with a 5 mm drill bit. This was repeated three to four times along the length of the colony for different annual growth bands. All samples were then ultrasonically cleaned in deionised water 3-4 times until no visible contaminants were evident and dried at 40°C on a hot-plate under contamination-free conditions (Shen et al., 2008).
U-series chemistry and analytical procedures:
Forty-three sub-samples from 11 living Porites coral colonies were prepared for U-Th dating using a VG-Sector-54 WARP-filtered high-abundance-sensitivity thermal ionisation mass spectrometer (TIMS) at the Radiogenic Isotope Facility (RIF), University of Queensland, following the analytical protocol described in detail in Zhao et al. (2001; 2009b) and Yu et al. (2006).

Initial 230Th/232Th calculation:
Previous studies have used living corals to resolve 230Th0 by calculating the value required to account for the difference between the ‘true age’ of the coral determined by annual band counting versus the actual U-series age (Cobb et al., 2003b; Yu et al., 2006; McCulloch and Mortimer, 2008; Burgess et al., 2009). Similarly in this study, 230Th/232Th0 values were calculated for live coral samples using the absolute band-counting ages of the corals obtained from X-ray images and the modified U-series age equation for young samples (&amp;lt;1000 years old) described by Zhao et al. (2009b).


Format of the data:

The dataset comprises of U-Th data obtained using thermal ionisation mass spectrometry (TIMS). Data is presented in a table in an excel spreadsheet with values for sample weight (g), U concentration (ppm), 232Th concentration (ppb), measured 230Th/232Th (activity ratio), 230Th/238U (activity ratio), ?234U (activity ratio), uncorrected 230Th age (in years), time of chemistry (years AD), growth band age (years AD), initial 230Th/232Th (atomic ratio), initial 230Th/232Th (activity ratio).

            <description type="full">The NCEP/NCAR (National Center for Environmental Protection/National Center for Atmospheric Research) Re-analysis 1 project (NCEP R-1) is an analysis/forecast system to perform data assimilation using past data from 1948 to the present. In 1998 NCEP/DOE (National Center for Environmental Protection/Department of Energy) partnered to produce the Re-analysis 2 project (NCEP R-2) to address model and human errors identified in the old reanalysis R-1 model. Several error fixes were introduced in going from R-1 to R-2, most importantly the Southern Hemisphere bogus data problem (1979-1992) that rendered R-1 almost unusable for Southern Hemisphere extratropical investigations for the affected years. The oceanic albedo was too high by a factor of about two for the entire reanalysis period, may have affected the Southern more than the Northern Hemisphere because of the greater proportion of ocean surface. Other errors were found with the snow-cover analysis, discontinuities in the relative humidity and cloudiness relationship table and a snow-melt term and the presence of an undesired &amp;#8220;spectral snow&amp;#8221; feature. Output of the NCEP R-1 product continues to be released to the present day, however, R-2 has only been performed for the years of 1979-2002 for detailed evaluation. These datasets can be found on cherax in the subdirectories for R1 (other gauss, pressure, spectral, surface, surface gauss and tropopause), which match the names used by NCEP in their anonymous server. For R-2 other gauss and surface gauss have been merged into gaussian grid, and tropopause data do not exist at this point in time. All variables that are a function of time are resolved every 6 hours (0h, 6h, 12h and 18h UTC), and a complete year of data is written to a single file (either 1460 or 1464 times depending on whether the particular year is a leap year). The pressure data are on a 2.5 by 2.5 degree horizontal grid ( 144 × 73 regular grid points) for each of the 17 pressure levels2. The surface and tropopause data are also on a 2.5 by 2.5 degree horizontal grid (144 × 73 regular grid points). The surface gauss and other gauss (or gaussian grid in R-2) data have an approximate 1.8 by 1.8 degree horizontal grid (192 × 94 Gaussian grid points or approximately 200 km horizontal spacing). The spectral data is in coefficient form, there are 4032 for the T62 model resolution. Seasonal and monthly climatologies are available for the period 1948-2003 for the R-1 data and 1979-2001 for the R-2 data. For every variable there are four types of average netCDF files that are referred to as long-term monthly (lm), longterm seasonal (ls), year-by-year monthly (ym) and year-by-year seasonal (ys). The four seasons are referred to with the abbreviations DJF (December, January and February average), MAM (March, April and May average), JJA (June, July and August average) and SON (September, October and November average).</description>

            <description type="brief">Metadata record for data from AAS (ASAC) project 3025.

Public
An ice core drilling expedition is proposed for Aurora Basin, between Law Dome and Dome C. This will provide a climate record in excess of 2000 years and will be used to compare coastal and inland Antarctic records. This will improve interpretation of ice core climate records and increase our knowledge of the role of Antarctica in the global climate system.

Project objectives:
The overall goal for this project is to recover a 2000 year plus climate record from a site ('GC41') in Aurora Basin, inland East Antarctica.

The project aims to achieve a number of objectives:
1   To provide a new, high resolution accurately dated, ice core climate record (greater than 2000 years) from the sparsely explored Aurora Basin region in the East Antarctic sector;

2   To gain an improved synthesis of the regional climate signals through better connection between the Law Dome (coastal) and EDC (inland) climate records in the pre-industrial late Holocene and into the period of anthropogenic climate change;

3   To provide better interpretation of ice core records through comparison of deposition and preservation mechanisms from the high accumulation coastal zone through to the low accumulation interior;

4   To contribute towards locating a site for drilling a very old record, in excess of 1 million years;

5   Finally, although not an objective with immediate scientific return, this project is designed to demonstrate and develop remote ice coring logistical capabilities using Australia's new combined inter-/intra-continental air transport system.

Taken from the 2008-2009 Progress Report:
Progress against objectives:
Ice core drilling at Aurora Basin (site GC41) was not achieved, however ice cores were recovered from Law Dome (site W10k, 127m; site DSS 10m), Mill Island (site MI 17m) and Totten Glacier (site TOT1 17m; TOT2 15m).

(a) Planning changes prior to getting into the field The shortened flying season due to a medical incident at Davis initially led to a clash for limited C212 resources on Casey station between the proposed ABN project and other C212 operational requirements (mainly the whale counting project). The whale counting project was given preference and it was suggested to modify the ABN project to reduce C212 requirements. A modified ABN project was proposed and accepted with the following changes:
- No mid-season changeover of personnel (this essentially ended the participation of the international field personnel)
- Lighter camp requiring less C212 deployment flights (we removed all field-based ice core processing tasks and consolidated our living arrangements, reducing power requirements and therefore fuel, generators and tents)
- Shortened our field season requiring less fuel/food (again removing ice core processing allowed for a faster drilling rate)

This proposed modified project would achieve the primary goal of retrieving an ice core, however it lost two very important components:
- International field participation (4 persons, Denmark and USA)
- Field based ice core processing

The medical incident at Davis led to delays in the A319 season and field personnel travelled to Casey by ship on V2 (instead of the planned A319 transport).

(b) Planning changes on getting into the field All 8 ABN field personnel arrived at Casey station on 1st December 2008. At Casey a number of reconnaissance flights and a skidrag were undertaken to Aurora Basin, however, we could not access our original GC41 drilling site. The topography at the site was considered too rough to land an aircraft. The surface was very different than that from reconnaissance in 2006/2007 and may be due to un-seasonal storm activity in the area? Further reconnaissance in the area failed to find a suitable landing site. These operational reasons led to withdrawing of the ABN project for 2008/2009.

This was not an issue exclusive to the C212 aircraft - it was the opinion of many that even the best available aircraft could not have landed at this site. The C212 aircraft proved very suitable for landing at other green-sites (Totten Glacier and Mill Island) and were a very easy platform to work from. We fully support C212 aircraft for this type of work.

This raises the issue of how to access Aurora Basin? Possibilities of how to access a site to groom a skiway need to be explored, including using traverse (either our own or possibly the French or a combination, and consideration of a lightweight traverse) or other aircraft (e.g. helicopters, twin otter etc).

Taken from the 2009-2010 Progress Report:
This year was spent processing and analysing the ice cores collected in the 2008/2009 field season. As stated in last years progress report (AAS 3025), this analysis was reported on in AAS 757, and will also be reported on here. This will result in duplication between this report and progress reported on in AAS 757.

Approximately 80% of the core processing and analysis has been achieved, including the handling of just over 19,000 samples (see table 2). It has been a busy year in the laboratory and a student (Chris Plummer) processed 2 of the PICO cores as part of an honours study at the University of Tasmania. Since this project Chris has come on board as a PhD student. This thesis was entitled 'The effect of snow accumulation rate on trace ion chemistry records on Law Dome'. Chris found that the chemistry species were predominantly wet deposited across Law Dome indicating that despite the accumulation differences, ice cores across the dome are sampling the same air mass.
Tessa Vance was employed to work on processing and analysing the ice cores for this project and has done a large amount of work on these cores. Tessa will finish up soon and begin a post-doc with us at the ACE CRC. We will hire a technical replacement for Tessa to assist Barbara Frankel to complete the remaining laboratory work.</description>

            <description type="full">With the aim of estimating the proportion of Antarctic minke whales (Balaenoptera bonaerensis) in pack ice over summer, an Australian fixed-wing aerial survey programme, based in east Antarctica, was conducted in the austral summers of 2007/2008, 2008/09 and 2009/10 (See Kelly et al. 2010; SC/62/IA8). The first season (2007/08) comprised of three 'test' flights. As such, there were no real 'survey' data collected during these three flights, but video and digital stills data have been included in the dataset supplied. 

The surveys (2008/09 and 2009/10) covered two general regions: Vincennes Bay (66 degrees 24'S 110 degrees 18'E) which was surveyed multiple times across both seasons and within the 2009/10 season, and north and east of the Shackleton Ice Shelf and into the eastern section of the Davis Sea, which was surveyed once (2009/10). The primary focus was on Antarctic minke whales, however sightings of other species were also collected (killer whale, Southern right whale, penguins and seals).

The survey was conducted in a CASA 212:400 aircraft at an altitude was 228m (750ft) and survey speed was 204 km/hr (110 knots). The survey was conducted as independent double-platform: the front and back observers were isolated visually and audibly. The aircraft was also fitted with a number of digital still, video and infrared cameras.
 
Data Available
1. Sighting data set

A .csv file of animal sightings. Two files, one for each survey season, has been supplied. The observers field of view was between 30 degrees and 60 degrees declination (approximately) from the horizon, corresponding to an on the ground area width of 264 metres each side of the aircraft. Protocol was followed as for traditional line transect surveys for marine mammals, with observers searching ahead of the aircraft in a 'D' pattern. 

The recorded observations consisted of cue counting (where possible) and the angle of declination when the animals were abeam to the observer (using a Suunto inclinometer). Cues were not recorded after the animals had moved past abeam. The angle of declination of groups was measured at the centre of the group. Perpendicular distance out to animals was calculated using angle of declination and flying height (but no correction for curvature of the earth or aircraft drift angle was applied).

Other information recorded included species, group size (minimum, maximum and best estimate), cue type, number of animals at surface when perpendicular, direction of travel and any behavioural features of the animal(s). 

Please note that no formal sighting data was collected for the January 2008 test flights. 

2. Effort data set

A .csv file of survey effort and environmental conditions. Two files, one for each survey season, has been supplied. The flight leader recorded environmental covariates (ice coverage (to the nearest 10%), glare, Beaufort sea state, and cloud cover, etc) at regular intervals, or when conditions changed.

3. Still images

The data includes jpeg files of images. A still camera was mounted vertically in the base of the aircraft to cover the trackline (10 megapixel Nikon D200 with 35mm lens); camera was situated behind a Perspex window. In addition in the final survey year (2009/10) two Nikon D300 cameras (12 megapixel with 50mm lens) were mounted at the side windows obliquely at an angle of 45 degrees (please note side-camera was used only during final season of survey, Dec 2009-Feb 2010). Focus set to infinity, and image settings given to account for high-light, high-contrast environments.  GPS/altitude data was embedded in each images EXIF information. Still image coverage underneath the aircraft was uninterrupted along the trackline with a shutter-release of around 1 photograph per second and a swath width of around 157 m.  Similarly the oblique mounted cameras had a coverage over 450 m each side of the trackline (i.e., configured to be approximately the same as the human observers).

4. Video cameras

A number of streampix video files. Two high definition video cameras (Prosilica GC1350C GigE with 5mm F1.4 lens) were also fitted to the aircraft. Streampix is propriety software.

5. Infrared 
A number of .mov files recorded from an Infra-red camera (FLIR Photon 320 with 9mm lens) mounted in the base of the aircraft. Infrared camera was situated behind an infrared window. 

6. Telemetry
A number of text files (.txt) containing aircraft telemetry (yaw/roll etc) and gps. The telemetry is not that reliable, nor does it go anywhere close to covering all flights conducted (see below), but included for completeness.

7. Flight data
'dat' files dumped from the aircraft flight recorder containing flight data, including geographical position, velocity and altitude. These are ascii files. 

8. GPS data
In addition to flight and telemetry data, we've also included two post-processed GPS data files (two .csv files, one for each survey season). These files contain GPS data from a number of sources; this was to help buffer against GPS drop-outs. Therefore, this data is much more complete than the telemetry and flight data, and has been corrected for any time syncing issues. 

9. "Season_overview_2010.xls" 
This Excel spreadsheet file contains details on each transect, effort and other sighting information. It accompanies the .csv files for the 2009/10 season as an overview. (A similar summary does not exist for 2008/09 season.)</description>

The Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) aims to manage the harvesting of living resources in the Southern Ocean in a manner that is sustainable to the harvested species, dependent species and ecosystem processes. The krill fishery is one of the major fisheries in the Southern Ocean. Application of CCAMLR's policy in management of the krill fishery requires sound scientific information on both krill and krill-dependent (predator) species. This program aims to provide the scientific information on krill predators required by CCAMLR for sustainable management of the krill fishery through research, survey and monitoring activities.

Taken from the 2009-2010 Progress Report:
Project objectives:
The Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) aims to manage the harvesting of living resources in the Southern Ocean in a manner that is sustainable to the harvested species, dependent species and ecosystem processes. The krill fishery is one of the major fisheries in the Southern Ocean. Application of CCAMLR's policy to management of the krill fishery requires sound scientific information on both krill and krill-dependent (predator) species. This program of work aims broadly to provide the scientific information on krill predators required by CCAMLR for sustainable management of the krill fishery in the Australian Antarctic Territory against a background of other impacts such as climate change, and compliments separate SOE projects aimed at krill itself.

This program is related to the previous multi-year project number 2205 (Adelie penguin research and monitoring in support of the CCAMLR Ecosystem Monitoring Project (CEMP)) but recognises and addresses recent developments in CCAMLR that include (i) the current development of a krill management procedure, (ii) a review of outputs from past CEMP work and recognition of the likely need to re-design CEMP to meet the needs of the new krill management procedure, and (iii) the need to estimate predator consumption of krill as part of the krill management procedure. Although the previous project 2205 focussed on Adelie penguins in the Mawson region exclusively, this new program will include consideration of additional species and regions to allow improvements in both ecosystem monitoring and estimation of krill consumption.

The program was approved in 2005 as a multi-year ASAC project with four major sub-programs or projects which have strong methodological and practical cross-linkages and overlap. The projects and their objectives are:

(1) Development of cost-effective methods for surveying and monitoring predator populations at the large spatial scales required by CCAMLR,
(2) Estimation of the abundance of krill predators in CCAMLR Statistical Areas 58.4.1 and 58.4.2 (which together span the width of the Australian Antarctic Territory),
(3) Assessment of spatio-temporal variability in predator performance parameters to enable the design of an effective and efficient monitoring program, and to examine metapopulation dynamics
(4) Continuation of selected aspects of project 2205 to (i) improve estimates and understanding of temporal variability and population dynamics and (ii) continue the application of CEMP.

We propose to continue these projects in 2008/09 and commence some additional projects. Projects (1) and (2) will be expanded beyond Adelie penguins to include some species of flying seabirds. Additional work related to the AAD's management of the Rookery Islands Specially Protected Area is proposed which would be undertaken in collaboration with the AADs environmental policy section, and aims to assess the status of the Southern Giant Petrel. It would be undertaken in conjunction with planned surveys of Adelie penguins and some flying seabird species in the Rookery Islands (project 2). Details of the work will be outlined in a separate proposal submitted by the AAD environmental policy section. A additional project is related to an IPY approved project focussing on Adelie penguins as indicators in the Southern Ocean. The objective of this new project is to co-ordinate some aspects of the work of Adelie penguin researchers around Antarctica to improve understanding of broad-scale processes in the Southern Ocean. A planning meeting in May 2007 had to be postponed until September 2007 and consequently it is not yet possible to outline the details of this project. We will provide project details as soon as possible after the September 2007 meeting and request that a late submission be accepted for this project.

Progress against objectives:

(1) Implementation and further development of cost-effective methods for surveying and monitoring predator populations at the large spatial scales required by CCAMLR.

Camera technology has been developed and is now being used to monitor Adelie penguin populations on several islands in the Mawson and Davis areas. Methods for cost-effective development of regional population size have also been developed and applied in the Mawson and Davis areas. Flying seabirds have been incorporated in the monitoring program by developing and implementing monitoring methods of snow petrel on Bechervaise Island.

(2) Estimation of the abundance of krill predators in CCAMLR Statistical Areas 58.4.1 and 58.4.2 (which together span the width of the Australian Antarctic Territory).

Aerial surveys were undertaken of Adelie penguin populations in the Vestfold Hills and Rauers Islands. Reconnaissance surveys of Adelie penguin distribution were conducted by the CASA aircraft between Casey and Mirny. Ground surveys of Adelie penguin populations were undertaken in the Mawson region

(3) Assessment of spatio-temporal variability in predator performance parameters to enable the design of an effective and efficient monitoring program, and to examine metapopulation dynamics.

Population surveys and the use of cameras at multiple sites in the Mawson area are providing data on Adelie penguin meta-population dynamics.

(4) Continuation of selected aspects of project 2205 to (i) improve estimates and understanding of temporal variability and population dynamics and (ii) continue the application of CEMP.

Measurement of Adelie penguin population size, foraging trip duration, breeding success and survival at Bechervaise Island continued in 2009/10

(5) Assessment of the winter foraging distribution of Adelie penguins.

Satellite trackers were successfully deployed on 15 fledgling Adelie penguins.</description>

By studying microbial within species adaptation, species distribution, ecosystem composition, structure and biogeochemical rates and functions, and relating these parameters to specific landforms at a range of spatial scales we aim to determine whether: Aspects of the Antarctic environment influence the scales and rates of biogeochemical processes and soil microbial population dynamics. and if so: Whether polar soil ecosystems are more sensitive to anthropogenic climate change than temperate regions.

Project objectives:
Do aspects of the Antarctic environment influence the scales and rates of biogeochemical processes and soil microbial population dynamics?

If so,

Are polar soil ecosystems more sensitive to anthropogenic climate change than temperate regions?

We aim to answer these two questions by studying within species adaptation, species distribution, ecosystem composition, structure and biogeochemical rates and functions. To do this, we will collect samples that relate to specific landforms at a range of spatial scales. We will then test the hypothesis that there are differences between sites (landforms), along gradients, between locations and between regions. This Antarctic data can then be compared to data from a much larger International Polar Year (IPY) latitudinal gradients project involving data from the Arctic (Canada and Norway) and temperate and tropical regions (Australia, Europe and low latitude Canada).

Taken from the 2008-2009 Progress Report:
Progress against objectives:
Soil samples have been collected from several sites in Antarctica and the Arctic in the past several years. These have been catalogued in a Sample Tracking Database developed by the EPiC group at the AAD. We have been concentrating on developing our methodology and devising a soil analysis system describing how each sample is subsampled and designating each subsample for particular chemical or genetic analysis. The method concentrates on making the most of the scarce amount of soil available due to the lack of soil development in most Antarctic coastal regions. We have reviewed the soil subsampling protocols and have sub-sampled the soils from the Robinsons Ridge and Main Powerhouse sites. Soil moisture content has been determined for these two sets of soil samples.

Herring Island, Mitchell Peninsula and Casey MPH (Bailey Peninsula) transects have already been subsampled and 10g samples processed at Macquarie University for the integron project.  Duplicate DNA samples have been extracted from the Robinsons and Main Powerhouse soils. One set of DNA extractions is stored at Macquarie University, while the duplicate set is stored at the AAD. DNA extractions have been confirmed as PCR competent, further PCR analysis has confirmed the presence of integrons and gene cassettes in these samples. We have begun to use amplification of a hypervariable region of the 16S rDNA gene followed by high resolution electrophoretic analysis to generate an overview of bacterial diversity along all soil transects. All subsamples have been entered into the Sample Tracking Database. 

Taken from the 2009-2010 Progress Report:
Soil samples have been collected that relate to specific landforms at a range of spatial scales from several sites in Antarctica and the Arctic.

Analysis of biogeochemical processes within these soils samples is being conducted. All 450 samples from the Antarctic transects have been analysed using the Mid-range infra red spectrometer, we also have total carbon and water content data for all these samples. The data for water content has been collected for the Norway transects (186 samples). The soil sub samples designated for different physical, chemical or genetic analysis have been distributed.

Duplicate DNA has been extracted for all Antarctic transects (Herring Island, Mitchell Peninsula, Browning Peninsula, Robinsons Ridge and Main Power House - Casey) and two Norwegian transects; Vestpynton Longyearbyen (Norway SV) and Spitsbergan Norway (Norway SS). This represents 2320 extractions in total, and the first steps towards investigating soil microbial population dynamics. All DNA extractions have been confirmed as PCR competent.

Further work towards understanding if aspects of the Antarctic environment influence the scales and rates of biogeochemical processes and soil microbial population dynamics has been conducted through examining the presence of integrons and gene cassettes in the samples Integrons and gene cassettes have been confirmed by sequencing and interrogation of BLAST databases. The focus of these investigations has been the Main Power House (MPH) transect. We have cloned sequences that show homology with gene cassettes from Cape Denison, Antarctica (ornothogenic soil) and with Halifax Bay marine sediment that are hydrocarbon contaminated. We are concentrating on intense cloning and sequencing of samples from MPH. This information will be use to develop quick method to identify Integrons and gene cassettes in the rest of samples. We are also trying to identify the integron found in Antarctic soil samples and driving the capture and expression of adaptive genes. Our laboratory is designing primers to target and amplify the integron and the first gene cassette.

We have begun to use amplification of part of the hypervariable region of the 16S rDNA gene followed by high resolution electophretic analysis to generate an overview of bacterial diversity along all soil transects.

A sub sample of every soil sample collected has been logged in the -80oC soil library at AAD and these samples have been catalogued in the Sample Tracking Database managed by the EPiC group.</description>

            <description type="brief">With the aim of estimating the proportion of Antarctic minke whales (Balaenoptera bonaerensis) in pack ice over summer, an Australian fixed-wing aerial survey programme, based in east Antarctica, was conducted in the austral summers of 2007/2008, 2008/09 and 2009/10 (See Kelly et al. 2010; SC/62/IA8). The first season (2007/08) comprised of three 'test' flights. As such, there were no real 'survey' data collected during these three flights, but video and digital stills data have been included in the dataset supplied. 

The surveys (2008/09 and 2009/10) covered two general regions: Vincennes Bay (66 degrees 24'S 110 degrees 18'E) which was surveyed multiple times across both seasons and within the 2009/10 season, and north and east of the Shackleton Ice Shelf and into the eastern section of the Davis Sea, which was surveyed once (2009/10). The primary focus was on Antarctic minke whales, however sightings of other species were also collected (killer whale, Southern right whale, penguins and seals).

The survey was conducted in a CASA 212:400 aircraft at an altitude was 228m (750ft) and survey speed was 204 km/hr (110 knots). The survey was conducted as independent double-platform: the front and back observers were isolated visually and audibly. The aircraft was also fitted with a number of digital still, video and infrared cameras.
 
Data Available
1. Sighting data set

A .csv file of animal sightings. Two files, one for each survey season, has been supplied. The observers field of view was between 30 degrees and 60 degrees declination (approximately) from the horizon, corresponding to an on the ground area width of 264 metres each side of the aircraft. Protocol was followed as for traditional line transect surveys for marine mammals, with observers searching ahead of the aircraft in a 'D' pattern. 

The recorded observations consisted of cue counting (where possible) and the angle of declination when the animals were abeam to the observer (using a Suunto inclinometer). Cues were not recorded after the animals had moved past abeam. The angle of declination of groups was measured at the centre of the group. Perpendicular distance out to animals was calculated using angle of declination and flying height (but no correction for curvature of the earth or aircraft drift angle was applied).

Other information recorded included species, group size (minimum, maximum and best estimate), cue type, number of animals at surface when perpendicular, direction of travel and any behavioural features of the animal(s). 

Please note that no formal sighting data was collected for the January 2008 test flights. 

2. Effort data set

A .csv file of survey effort and environmental conditions. Two files, one for each survey season, has been supplied. The flight leader recorded environmental covariates (ice coverage (to the nearest 10%), glare, Beaufort sea state, and cloud cover, etc) at regular intervals, or when conditions changed.

3. Still images

The data includes jpeg files of images. A still camera was mounted vertically in the base of the aircraft to cover the trackline (10 megapixel Nikon D200 with 35mm lens); camera was situated behind a Perspex window. In addition in the final survey year (2009/10) two Nikon D300 cameras (12 megapixel with 50mm lens) were mounted at the side windows obliquely at an angle of 45 degrees (please note side-camera was used only during final season of survey, Dec 2009-Feb 2010). Focus set to infinity, and image settings given to account for high-light, high-contrast environments.  GPS/altitude data was embedded in each images EXIF information. Still image coverage underneath the aircraft was uninterrupted along the trackline with a shutter-release of around 1 photograph per second and a swath width of around 157 m.  Similarly the oblique mounted cameras had a coverage over 450 m each side of the trackline (i.e., configured to be approximately the same as the human observers).

4. Video cameras

A number of streampix video files. Two high definition video cameras (Prosilica GC1350C GigE with 5mm F1.4 lens) were also fitted to the aircraft. Streampix is propriety software.

5. Infrared 
A number of .mov files recorded from an Infra-red camera (FLIR Photon 320 with 9mm lens) mounted in the base of the aircraft. Infrared camera was situated behind an infrared window. 

6. Telemetry
A number of text files (.txt) containing aircraft telemetry (yaw/roll etc) and gps. The telemetry is not that reliable, nor does it go anywhere close to covering all flights conducted (see below), but included for completeness.

7. Flight data
'dat' files dumped from the aircraft flight recorder containing flight data, including geographical position, velocity and altitude. These are ascii files. 

8. GPS data
In addition to flight and telemetry data, we've also included two post-processed GPS data files (two .csv files, one for each survey season). These files contain GPS data from a number of sources; this was to help buffer against GPS drop-outs. Therefore, this data is much more complete than the telemetry and flight data, and has been corrected for any time syncing issues. 

9. "Season_overview_2010.xls" 
This Excel spreadsheet file contains details on each transect, effort and other sighting information. It accompanies the .csv files for the 2009/10 season as an overview. (A similar summary does not exist for 2008/09 season.)</description>

Public 
Ecological sustainability of fisheries is a primary goal for managing human activities in the marine environment. Management decisions must be based on clear, operational objectives and reliable assessment methods that are robust against uncertainties in our understanding of how the ecosystem functions, measurement error and natural variation. This project aims to provide the tools for developing management procedures for Antarctic and Sub-Antarctic fisheries. These tools will include a flexible set of ecosystem and food web models of the Antarctic and Sub-Antarctic regions for testing management procedures before they are put into practice.

Project objectives:
PROJECT THEMES AND KEY QUESTIONS

The themes of this work aim to provide a framework for determining how to manage Antarctic fisheries, such as Antarctic krill, Patagonian toothfish and mackerel icefish:
a.   Models of the Antarctic Marine Ecosystem
b.   Biology and Ecology of Fish in the Southern Indian Ocean
c.   Management Procedures for Antarctic Fisheries

a/ Models of the Antarctic Marine Ecosystem

Key Questions
- What is the status of knowledge on Antarctic and Sub-Antarctic vertebrates and squid, including population status and trends, demography, and diet?
- What plausible operating models can be developed for Antarctic and Sub-Antarctic systems that take account of spatial heterogeneity and temporal variability?

b/ Biology and Ecology of Fish in the Southern Indian Ocean

Key Questions
- Fisheries-related research at Heard Island and McDonald Islands
- What are the population dynamics of toothfish and icefish stocks in the region of Heard Island and McDonald Islands?
- How does primary and secondary productivity vary spatially and temporally in the region? What are the primary causes of variability in the region?
- What is the strength of interactions between land-based predators and commercially fished species in the region?
- Ecology of fish in the southern Indian Ocean Fish of the Kerguelen Plateau /Crozet Region
- What is the composition of fish fauna around and to the west of Kerguelen Plateau /Crozet ? What factors influence the distribution and abundance of these fauna?
- What is the relationship between the distribution and abundance of fish fauna and the habitat features of the continental shelf in the Kerguelen region?

c/ Management Procedures for Antarctic Fisheries

Key Questions
- What operational objectives could be used as a guide to managing fisheries in an ecologically sustainable way?
- What are performance measures for target species and food webs?
- What are the key parameters to monitor the status of the system to signal change before it becomes irreversible?
- What quantitative/statistical methods are best used for assessing the status of populations and ecosystems?
- How might an integrated modelling framework be designed to best facilitate the development of management procedures for Antarctic fisheries?
- Could a spatially-structured management system, such as a mosaic of open and closed areas, enhance the approaches to managing fisheries in the Antarctic? 

Taken from the 2008-2009 Progress Report:
Public summary of the season progress:
The Ecological and Resource Modelling and Fish and Fisheries Ecology group has made significant contributions to understanding the commercial fish stocks and ecosystem in the vicinity of Heard Island, has coordinated the fisheries observer program in CCAMLR waters, and has contributed significantly to the scientific work of CCAMLR, particularly in relation to ecosystem modelling, stock assessment and conservation of the Southern Ocean. 

Taken from the 2009-2010 Progress Report:
Progress against objectives:
a) Models of the Antarctic Marine Ecosystem
Further progress has been made on quantifying the spatial variation in the productivity of krill through the development of a krill productivity model in the Ecosystem Productivity Ocean Climate modelling framework.
Further estimation of population parameters for toothfish and icefish.
Further development of an ecosystem model for Heard Island.
Further work to develop and evaluate management strategies for Antarctic fisheries through the CCAMLR Working Group on Statistics, Assessments and Modelling (WG-SAM) of which Andrew Constable is the Convenor.

b) Biology and Ecology of Fish in the Southern Indian Ocean
Twelve months of intensive processing of otolith samples has resulted in the preparation and ageing of over 5,000 otoliths of Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides), collected over the past 10 years from the Heard Island - McDonald Islands (HIMI) fishery and the Macquarie Island fishery. Patagonian toothfish otolith ageing and microchemistry work will continue over a number of years.

Further processing, maintenance and cataloguing of the collection of preserved fish specimens has been undertaken.

Work has also continued on the processing and cataloguing of benthic samples collected by observers or field work previously undertaken in the HIMI region. This work continues to increase the known diversity of benthic fauna of the HIMI region.

c) Management Procedures for Antarctic Fisheries
Contribution of advice to the Subantarctic Resource Assessment Group of AFMA.

Contribution of advice to the CCAMLR Working Groups, WG-FSA and WG-EMM on the evaluation of management strategies and assessments of stocks for fisheries in which Australia is involved, including Heard Island as well as in new and exploratory fisheries in higher latitudes.

Contribution in WG-FSA and SC-CAMLR on issues pertaining to the CCAMLR observer scheme and at sea implementation of conservation measures. Dirk Welsford is the Co-Convenor for the CCAMLR Technical Group on At-Sea Operations (TASO) which held its first meeting in July 2008 and reports directly to SC-CAMLR and its Working Groups.

Contribution from project 2942 to Australian Delegation to CCAMLR resulted in the following outcomes being achieved:
1) Catch limit on BANZARE Bank was reduced to zero pending results of research fishing in 2009/10 (CONSERVATION MEASURE 41-07, 2009)
2) Reduction of the catch limit and enforcement of the need for a recovery plan from a proposal by Japan to undertake fishing for scientific research in a closed area on Ob and Lena Banks. Australia endorsed the need for ongoing review of 'scientific fishing' programs such as those proposed by Japan.
3) The need for systematic observation on all krill fishing vessels to achieve CCAMLR objectives and development of new conservation measure 51-06 for scientific observer coverage on krill fishery.
4) Endorsement of the need for robust otolith sampling strategies and comprehensive age-length datasets as key inputs into Dissostichus assessments and the need for quality control processes in ageing programs.
5) Endorsement of the Scientific Committee to use PATCH model to evaluate impacts of fishing on VMEs.
6) Adoption of toothfish assessment strategy and results , and yield recommendations for next 2 seasons, (CONSERVATION MEASURE 41-08)
7) Adoption for icefish survey assessment strategy and results and recommended yield for next season. (CONSERVATION MEASURE 42-02).
8) Endorsements of current by-catch limits and rates of by-catches in 58.5.2 as being appropriate at mitigating significant impacts on skates.

The assessment for TOP (Candy and Constable, 2008) was revised using catch-at-age data as a key outcome of the FRDC funded work involving ageing of TOP catch and construction of age length keys at HIMI (Welsford et al, 2009; Candy and Welsford, 2009).</description>

            <description type="brief">INDICATOR DEFINITION
      The Deep Lake surface level indicator is defined as the depth below sea level of the surface of Deep Lake in the Vestfold Hills.
      
      TYPE OF INDICATOR
      There are three types of indicators used in this report:
      1.Describes the CONDITION of important elements of a system;
      2.Show the extent of the major PRESSURES exerted on a system;
      3.Determine RESPONSES to either condition or changes in the condition of a system.
      
      This indicator is one of: CONDITION
      
      RATIONALE FOR INDICATOR SELECTION
      Deep Lake is the most saline of the lakes of the Vestfold Hills, and due to its salinity, has never been known to completely freeze. It is the only major lake in Antarctica with this characteristic, which makes it a prime candidate for monitoring water levels. This was recognised many years ago, and the water level has been monitored on a monthly basis since 1976. This 25-year long database is one of the longest non-weather records of the natural environment in Antarctica. Significant changes in the water level have been observed over this time.
      
      The water level is related to water balance, that is the difference between inputs by direct precipitation or from melt of snow banks in the drainage basin, and losses, which include evaporation when the lake is ice free and ablation when it ice covered.
      
      Net loss terms are thought to be relatively constant from year to year, and therefore water level is a measure of net precipitation. This may be direct (falling within the drainage basin) or indirect (initially falling elsewhere, but blown into the drainage basin by strong winds).
      
      The water level of Deep Lake is a technologically simple measure of an important parameter. The long existing database should be continued, and means that all data collected can immediately be put into a long-term view.
      
      DESIGN AND STRATEGY FOR INDICATOR MONITORING PROGRAM
      
      Spatial scale: Deep Lake in the Vestfold Hills near Davis Station Antarctica.
      
      Selection of Monitor. One member of the wintering group at Davis each year will be designated the Deep Lake monitor, preferably during pre-departure training. This person should discuss the project with the indicator custodian, and be comfortable with the requirements of the position prior to leaving for Antarctica. In the past, the person responsible for the measurements has often been a non-scientist who otherwise would not normally get off base regularly. This role provides a mechanism by which non-scientists can become involved in a long term scientific program.
      
      If at all possible, there should be a joint visit to Deep Lake by the outgoing and incoming monitors over summer so that details of the location of the pole, method for reading and input of the data into SIMR can be passed on. It is recognised that this may not be possible during changeover, but if the monitors share a longer period together on base, such a visit to the lake should be made.
      
      If the Deep Lake monitor has to leave Davis before winter, or no longer feels he or she is able to fulfil this role, another expeditioner should be designated to maintain continuity of the record.
      
      Frequency: Readings of the surface level of Deep Lake should be taken monthly, preferably within the last few days of any month. A week prior the end of the month, an email will be sent to the Deep Lake monitor reminding him or her that a measurement is due. If no data have been input into the SIMR system by the end of the month, another email will be sent, which will be copied to the Station Leader. This formal monthly reading does not preclude other visitors to the lake recording data. Any expeditioners visiting the lake should be encouraged to record data and pass it on to the designated monitor for inclusion within SIMR. If readings input appear to be in error, the Indicator Custodian will contact the monitor and either work out the problem or request another measurement be made.
      
      Technique: Water level is measured by use of a marked pole located near the edge of the lake, which is in turn tied in to a nearby, accurately surveyed, benchmark. The pole is marked in at 1 cm intervals, and should be read to the closest centimetre. At least two expeditioners should make independent estimates of the water level, which are then compared and a consensus reached.  This value, which is a relative, rather than direct measure of the water level of Deep Lake, is input into the SIMR system.  While at the lake, note should be taken of the state of the pole. If any change in the position of the pole has occurred since the last visit, an email should be sent to the Indicator Custodian, giving details.
      
      The position of the pole should be checked on an annual basis over summer. This process can be done by surveyors, or, if none are available at Davis, by expeditioners after consultation with the Indicator Custodian and the Mapping Officer, Antarctic Division.
      
      On the 22 Feb 2000, the base or zero reading of the &amp;Tide Pole&amp; at Deep Lake was 51.333 metres below sea level. To derive the water level of Deep Lake below mean sea level, the water level reading on the &amp;Tide Pole&amp; is added to -51.333. Note that this is a negative value so any water level readings will produce a smaller negative number.
      
      RESEARCH ISSUES
      The annual cycle in water level can be readily explained, but longer-term variations are more difficult.
      
      The input and output terms are understood, but how these are controlled by the weather is less clear. Analysis of the water level data as well as weather data from Davis station currently underway should clarify the situation.

            <description type="brief">From the abstract of some of the papers:

It has been suggested that increased springtime UVB radiation caused by stratospheric ozone depletion is likely to reduce primary production and induce changes in the species composition of Antarctic marine phytoplankton. Experiments conducted at Arthur Harbour in the Antarctic Peninsula revealed a reduction in primary productivity at both ambient and increased levels of UVB.  Laboratory studies have shown that most species in culture are sensitive to high UVB levels, although the level at which either growth or photosynthesis is inhibited is variable.  Stratospheric ozone depletion, with resultant increased springtime UVB irradiance, has been occurring with increasing severity since the late 1970's.  Thus the phytoplankton community has already experienced about 20 years' exposure to increasing levels of UVB radiation.  Here we present analyses of diatom assemblages from high-resolution stratigraphic sequences from anoxic basins in fjords of the Vestfold HIlls, Antarctica.  We find that compositional changes in the diatom component of the phytoplankton community over the past 20 years cannot be distinguished from long-term natural variability, although there is some indication of a decline in the production of some sea-ice diatoms.  We anticipate that our results are applicable to other Antarctic coastal regions, where thick ice cover and the timing of the phytoplankton bloom protect the phytoplankton from the effects of increased UVB radiation.

Growth rate, survival, and stimulation of the production of UV-B (280 to 320 nm) absorbing compounds were investigated in cultures of five commonly occurring Antarctic marine diatoms exposed to a range of UV-B irradiances. Experimental UV-B exposures ranged from 20 to 650% of the measured peak surface irradiance at an Antarctic coastal site (0.533 J per square metre per second).  The five diatom species (Nitzschia lecointei, Proboscia alata, P. inermis, Thalassiosira tumida and Stellarima microtrias) appear capable of surviving two to four times this irradiance.  In contrast to Phaeocystis cf. pouchetti, another major component of the Antarctic phytoplankton, the concentrations of pigments with discrete UV absorption peaks in diatoms were low and did not change significantly under increasing UV-B irradiance. Absorbance of UV-B by cells from which pigments had been extracted commonly exceeded that of the pigments themselves.  Most of this absorbance was due to oxidisable cell contents, with the frustule providing the remainder.  Survival of diatoms did not correlate with absorption by either pigments, frustules or oxidisable cell contents, indicating that their survival under elevated UV-B irradiances results from processes other than screening mechanisms.

Springtime UV-B levels have been increasing in Antarctic marine ecosystems since the 1970's.  Effects on natural phytoplankton and sea-ice algal communities, however, remain unresolved.  At the Marginal Ice Edge Zone, enhanced springtime UV-B levels coincide with a shallow, stratified water column and a major phytoplankton bloom.  In these areas it is possible that phytoplankton growth and survival is adversely impacted by enhanced UV-B.  In coastal areas, however, the sea ice, which attenuates most of the UV-B before it reaches the water column, remains until December/January, by which time UV-B levels have returned to long-term seasonal averages.  Phytoplankton from these areas are unlikely to show long-term changes resulting from the hole in the ozone layer.  Fjords of the Vestfold Hills, eastern Antarctica, have anoxic basins which contain high-resolution, unbioturbated sedimentary sequences.  Diatom assemblages from these sequences reflect the diatom component of the phytoplankton and sea-ice algal assemblages at the time of deposition.  Twenty-year records from these sequences show no consistent record of change in species composition, diversity or species richness. Six-hundred-year records from the same area also show changes in species abundance greater than those seen in the last 20 years.  From these records it can be seen that recent changes in diatom abundances generally fall within the limits of natural variability and there is little evidence of recent changes that might be associated with UV-B-induced change.</description>

            <description type="brief">An integrated field, geochemical, isotopic and geochronological study of Gaussberg: Constraints on timing, character and petrogenesis of holocene lamproitic volcanics in the eastern Antarctica Shield and the nature of the underlying lithosphere.

Available for download are three tables of data in spreadsheet form, as well as two papers arising from the work (in pdf format).

From the abstracts of the attached papers:
Petrogenetic models for the origin of lamproites are evaluated using new major element, trace element, and Sr, Nd, and Pb isotope data for Holocene lamproites from the Gaussberg volcano in the East Antarctic shield.  Gaussberg lamproites exhibit very unusual Pb isotope compositions (206Pb/204Pb = 17.44-17.55 and 207Pb/204Pb = 15.56-15.63), which in common Pb isotope space plot above mantle evolution lines and to the left of the meteorite isochron. Combined with very unradiogenic Nd, such compositions are shown to be inconsistent with an origin by melting of sub-continental lithospheric mantle.  Instead, a model is proposed in which late Archaean continent-derived sediment is subducted as K-hollandite and other ultra-high pressure phases and sequestered in the Transition Zone (or lower mantle) where it is effectively isolated for 2-3 Gyr.  The high 207Pb/204Pb ratio is thus inherited from ancient continent derived sediment, and the relatively low 206Pb/204Pb ratio is the result of a single stage of U/Pb fractionation by subduction-realted U loss during slab dehydration.  Sr and Nd isotope ratios, and trace element characteristics (eg Nb/Ta rations) are consistent with sediment subduction and dehydration-related fractionation.  Similar models that use variable time of isolation of subducted sediment can be derived for all lamproites.  Our interpretation of lamproite sources has important implications for ocean island basalt petrogenesis as well as the preservation of geochemically anomalous reservoirs in the mantle.

The first terrestrial Pb-isotope paradox refers to the fact that on average, rocks from the Earth's surface (ie the accessible Earth) plot significantly to the right of the meteorite isochron in a common Pb-isotope diagram.  The Earth as a whole, however, should plot close to the meteorite isochron, implying the existence of at least one terrestrial reservoir that plots to the left of the meteorite isochron.  The core and the lower continental crust are the two candidates that have been widely discussed in the past.  Here we propose that subducted oceanic crust and associated continental sediment stored as garnetite slabs in the mantle Transition Zone or mid-lower mantle are an additional potential reservoir that requires consideration.  We present evidence from the literature that indicates that neither the core nor the lowest crust contains sufficient unradiogenic Pb to balance the accessible Earth.  Of all mantle magmas, only rare alkaline melts plot significantly to the left of the meteorite isochron.  We interpret these melts to be derived from the missing mantle reservoir that plots to the left of the meteorite isochron but significantly, above the mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB)-source mantle evolution line.  Our solution to the paradox predicts the bulk silicate Earth to be more radiogenic in 207Pb/204Pb than present-day MORB-source mantle, which opens the possibility that undegassed primitive mantle might be the source of certain ocean island basalts (OIB).  Further implications for mantle dynamics and oceanic magmatism are discussed based on a previously justified proposal that lamproites and associated rocks could derive from the Transition Zone.

Public 
Climate change and feral animals are having profound effects on Macquarie Island, threatening its World Heritage values. Through the use of lake sediments and peat deposits we will examine how the climate has changed in the past, what it was like before feral animals were introduced, and the rate and extent of changes since. This essential information will ensure successful future conservation and restoration and provide a series of measures to assess the recovery of Macquarie Island once the feral animals have been removed.

Project Objectives:
Macquarie Island is a key site for understanding both Southern Hemisphere and global climate and ecosystem changes as it is one of the few landmasses in the Southern Ocean and one of the few sub-Antarctic islands between 45 degrees and 60 degrees S. Furthermore, it has World Heritage status and is a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve (the only Biosphere Reserve in the sub-Antarctic biogeographic region). Macquarie Island is therefore of considerable global ecological and conservation significance.

In order to understand environmental changes occurring on Macquarie Island and to make realistic predictions about future scenarios, it is critical to determine and quantify natural and human-induced causes of change and variability. This can only be achieved by understanding the long term magnitude and direction of natural environmental change, establishing the 'baseline' status of the environment prior to human impacts, and then use this information to separate subsequent natural from human-induced change.

This project seeks to:

Objective 1
Quantify high resolution long term environmental (climate and ecosystem) change on Macquarie Island over the last 10,000 years in terms of:
(i) Temperature and precipitation (using established Macquarie Island diatom transfer functions and in-situ reflectance spectroscopy of lake sediments)
(ii) Vegetation assemblages (by pollen, plant macrofossil and DNA analyses of lake and peat sediments)
(iii) Abundance, presence and absence of selected fauna, including non-indigenous species (using lacustrine invertebrate microfossils and DNA analyses of lake sediments)
(iv) Erosion rates (by measuring sedimentation and accumulation rates in lakes using radioisotope dating).

Objective 2
Quantify changes in all of the above variables during the period of human impact (1810-present) to identify ecological anomalies (i.e., changes outside the range of natural variability). In particular, changes attributable to recent shifts in climate and/or the impacts of rabbits will be measured.

Objective 3
Integrate changes in each of the above parameters to provide a multiproxy quantification of the effects of long term climate and ecosystem changes on Macquarie Island and an assessment of the impact of feral animals, in particular rabbits. This will provide a framework and set of tools for measuring the extent to which environmental change has occurred due to natural vs. human causes and consequently, the extent to which management targets have been achieved. These tools will consist of straightforward analyses of material incorporated into sediments (e.g., sediment traps) and other records of environmental change (e.g., surface sediments and peat development).

The aim of the project was to investigate whether or not a lake sediment core from Macquarie Island could be used to determine the characteristics of the lake prior to the introduction of rabbits and the rates/extent of changes since. This was motivated by wanting to assess the potential of a palaeoecological approach to determine baseline information for assessing the recovery of the island after the eradication of rabbits.

A short (50.5 cm) sediment core was collected from Emerald Lake (54 degrees 40'22"S, 158 degrees 52'14"E), northwest Macquarie Island.

The core was sectioned at 0.5 cm intervals in the field. Samples were transporting back to the University of Tasmania where the analyses were completed.

Analyses undertaken were:
1. Dating the sediment core (210Pb and 14C)
2. Geochemical and physical analyses (water content, organic macrofossils, total carbon, nitrogen and sulphur)
3. Diatom analyses

The data provided are raw data for each of the above (in one excel spreadsheet). There are two spreadsheets for the diatom data:
1. Species used in the final publication (species greater than 10% relative abundance). The full species names are provided in this spreadsheet.
2. All species identified, listed using their species codes as designated by K. Saunders. A separate file (AAS3117 Diatom information) is attached that lists all diatom codes and species names.

210Pb dating was undertaken at the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation.
14C dating was undertaken at ANSTO and Rafter Radiocarbon, New Zealand
Geochemical and physical analyses were undertaken at the University of Bern (Institute of Geography)
Diatom analyses were undertaken by K. Saunders at the Universities of Bern and Tasmania

All analyses were performed using standard procedures.

This information was used to qualitatively assess the status of the lake prior to the introduction of rabbits and the rate/extent of changes afterwards.

The main findings were (Abstract from Saunders et al. 2014):
The introduction and establishment of non-indigenous species through human activities often poses a major threat to natural biodiversity. In many parts of the world management efforts are therefore focused on their eradication. The environment of World Heritage sub-Antarctic Macquarie Island has been severely damaged by non-indigenous species including rabbits, rats and mice, introduced from the late AD 1800s. An extensive eradication program is now underway which aims to remove all rabbits and rodents. To provide a long-term context for assessing the Island's pre-invasion state, invasion impacts, and to provide a baseline for monitoring its recovery, we undertook a palaeoecological study using proxies in a lake sediment core. Sedimentological and diatom analyses revealed an unproductive catchment and lake environment persisted for ca. 7100 years prior to the introduction of the invasive species. After ca. AD 1898, unprecedented and statistically significant environmental changes occurred. Lake sediment accumulation rates increased greater than 100 times due to enhanced catchment inputs and within-lake production. Total carbon and total nitrogen contents of the sediments increased by a factor of four. The diatom flora became dominated by two previously rare species. The results strongly suggest a causal link between the anthropogenic introduction of rabbits and the changes identified in the lake sediments. This study provides an example of how palaeoecology may be used to determine baseline conditions prior to the introduction of non-indigenous species, quantify the timing and extent of changes, and help monitor the recovery of the ecosystem and natural biodiversity following successful non-indigenous species eradication programs.</description>

            <description type="brief">Precise information on the relative timing of north-south climate variations is a key to resolving questions concerning the mechanisms that force and couple climate changes between the hemispheres. We present a new composite record made from five well-resolved Antarctic ice core records that robustly represents the timing of regional Antarctic climate change during the last deglaciation. Using fast variations in global methane gas concentrations as time markers, the Antarctic composite is directly compared to Greenland ice core records, allowing a detailed mapping of the inter-hemispheric sequence of climate changes. Consistent with prior studies the synchronized records show that warming (and cooling) trends in Antarctica closely match cold (and warm) periods in Greenland on millennial timescales. For the first time, we also identify a sub-millennial component to the inter-hemispheric coupling. Within the Antarctic Cold Reversal the strongest Antarctic cooling occurs during the pronounced northern warmth of the Bolling. Warming then resumes in Antarctica, potentially as early as the Intra-Allerod Cold Period, but with dating uncertainty that could place it as late as the onset of the Younger Dryas stadial. There is little-to-no time lag between climate transitions in Greenland and opposing changes in Antarctica. Our results lend support to fast acting inter-hemispheric coupling mechanisms including recently proposed bipolar atmospheric teleconnections and/or rapid bipolar ocean teleconnections.

The five cores used in the Antarctic deglacial water isotope composite are: Law Dome, Byrd, EPICA Dronning Maud Land (EDML), Siple Dome and Talos Dome. The data for each core is interpolated to 20 year time steps and standardised with respect to its own mean and standard deviation over the interval 9000 to 21000 years before 1950 AD (9-21 ka BP 1950). Estimated dating uncertainty in the composite (relative to GICC05) is +/- 220 y during the interval 10-13 ka BP, +/- 200 y during the interval 13-15 ka BP and +/- 380 y during the interval 15-18 ka BP. Refer to Pedro et al., (in press) (Table 2) and original references (below) for dating uncertainties in the individual cores.

            <description type="brief">A sediment core was collected from the western side of Pidgeon Island, (66.3216 S, 110.445 E) at a water depth of 82.0 m.  This sediment core (PG 1411-2) was recovered using a release-controlled piston corer, with a length of 3 m, using the coring technique described in Melles et al., (1994). The total core length was 240 cm.  This core was stored in the dark, at 0  degrees C until required.  Samples were taken for diatom analyses and  radiocarbon (14C) dating.  Prior to sub-sampling the core was split in half,  along its length. One half was used for sampling, the other kept intact and  stored at IASOS (University of Tasmania).  To reduce potential contamination,  resulting from the disturbance of sediments during the core-splitting  procedure, a thin layer of sediment was removed from the exposed surface  immediately prior to sampling.

In order to obtain samples for diatom analysis, a toothpick was inserted into the core segment, and used to gouge a small amount of sediment from the middle of the core.  Samples for diatom analyses were initially collected every 5 mm, however, sampling frequency progressively decreased down the core.  Samples for radiocarbon data consisted of at least 1 cm 3 of sediment, collected from the middle of the core.  These samples were collected from between 0-1 cm, 12-13 cm, 59-60 cm, 77-78 cm, 117-118 cm, and 229-230 cm depth.

Diatom data are presented as raw counts, benthic abundances, the ratio of benthic to plankton species, and as the benthic index.  Calculated ages (in years) are also given for all samples.  The sedimentological core log is given as a powerpoint presentation.

This work was completed as part of ASAC project 1130 (ASAC_1130) and project 2201 (ASAC_2201).

Public summary from project 1130:

Algal mats grow on sea floor in most shallow marine environments.  They are thought to contribute more than half of the total primary production in many of these areas, making them a critical food source for invertebrates and some fish.  We will establish how important they are in Antarctic marine environments and determine the effects of local sewerage and tip site pollution.  We will also investigate the impact on the algal mats of the additional UV radiation which results from the ozone hole.

Public summary from project 2201:

As a signatory to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty Australia is committed to comprehensive protection of the Antarctic environment. This protocol requires that activities in the Antarctic shall be planned and conducted on the basis of information sufficient to make prior assessments of, and informed judgements about, their possible impacts on the Antarctic environment. Most of our activities in the Antarctic occur along the narrow fringe of ice-free rock adjacent to the sea and many of our activities have the potential to cause environmental harm to marine life. The Antarctic seas support the most complex and biologically diverse plant and animal communities of the region. However, very little is known about them and there is certainly not sufficient known to make informed judgements about possible environmental impacts.

The animals and plants of the sea-bed are widely accepted as being the most appropriate part of the marine ecosystem for indicating disturbance caused by local sources. Attached sea-bed organisms have a fixed spatial relationship with a given place so they must either endure conditions or die. Once lost from a site recolonisation takes some time, as a consequence the structure of sea-bed communities reflect not only present conditions but they can also integrate conditions in the past. In contrast, fish and planktonic organisms can move freely so their site of capture does not indicate a long residence time at that location. Because sea-bed communities are particularly diverse they contain species with widely differing life strategies, as a result different species can have very different levels of tolerance to stress; this leads to a range of subtle changes in community structure as a response to gradually increasing disturbance, rather than an all or nothing response.

This project will examine sea-bed communities near our stations to determine how seriously they are affected by human activities. This information will be used to set priorities for improving operational procedures to reduce the risk of further environmental damage.

            <description type="brief">A hierarchical, 3-level, nested design was used. The highest hierarchical level consisted of six locations. Two of these locations, Brown Bay and Shannon Bay, have been contaminated with heavy metals (Stark et al., 2003; Snape et al., 2001); Brown Bay has also been contaminated with petroleum hydrocarbons (Snape et al., 2001). The remaining four locations are more distant from Casey Station and were used as control locations. These locations were Denison Island, Odbert Island, O'Brien Bay and Sparkes Bay. A full description of these sites is given below.

Within each location two sites were selected approximately 100 m apart. Within each site, two plots were sampled (~ 10 m apart). Although the sampling program had been designed for four replicates within each plot, the patchy distribution of bottom sediments in the Windmill Islands restricted this to two replicate samples (~ 1 m apart) per plot. Samples were collected using an Eckman grab sampler, deployed from a boat. To minimise the potential influence of water depth, all samples were collected from 8 m water depth. Samples were collected within a three day period in early February when no sea-ice was present.

Diatom data are presented as the relative abundances of benthic species. Samples are identified xyz where x = first initial of sample location (or first 2 initials where 2 locations start with the same letter), y = plot number (plots 1 and 2 represent site 1, while plots 3 and 4 are from site 2), and z = replicate number (a or b).  Abbreviations used for species are shown in the separate file sp_list.

            <description type="brief">Study location and test species
Subantarctic Macquarie Island lies in the Southern Ocean, just north of the Antarctic Convergence at 54 degrees 30' S, 158 degrees 57' E. Its climate is driven by oceanic processes, resulting in highly stable daily and inter-seasonal air and sea temperatures (Pendlebury and Barnes-Keoghan, 2007). Temperatures in intertidal rock pools (0.5 to 2 m deep) were logged with Thermochron ibuttons over two consecutive summers and averaged 6.5 (plus or minus 0.5)  degrees C. The island is relatively pristine and in many areas there has been no past exposure to contamination. To confirm sites used for invertebrate collections were free from metal contamination, seawater samples were taken and analysed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES; Varian 720-ES; S1)

The four invertebrate species used in this study were drawn from a range of taxa and ecological niches (Figure 1). The isopod Limnoria stephenseni was collected from floating fronds of the kelp Macrosystis pyrifera, which occurs several hundred meters offshore. The copepod Harpacticus sp. and bivalve Gaimardia trapesina were collected from algal species in the high energy shallow, subtidal zone. Finally, the flatworm Obrimoposthia ohlini was collected from the undersides of boulders throughout the intertidal zone. We hypothesised L. stephenseni would be particularly sensitive to changes in salinity and temperature due to its distribution in the deeper and relatively stable subtidal areas, while O. ohlini would be less sensitive due to its distribution high in the intertidal zone and exposure to naturally variable conditions.  We reasoned that the remaining two species, G. trapesina, and Harpacticus sp. were intermediate in the conditions to which they are naturally exposed and hence would likely be intermediate in their response. 

Test procedure
The combined effect of salinity, temperature and copper on biota was determined using a multi-factorial design. A range of copper concentrations were tested with each combination of temperatures and salinities, so that there were up to 9 copper toxicity tests simultaneously conducted per species (Table 1). Experiments on L. stephenseni and Harpacticus sp. were done on Macquarie Island within 2 to 3 days of collection, during which they were acclimated to laboratory conditions.  While, G. trapesina and O. ohlini were transported by ship to Australia in a recirculating aquarium system and maintained in a recirculating aquarium at the Australian Antarctic Division in Hobart, both at 6 degreesC. These two taxa were used in experiments within 3 months of their collection.  A limited number of G. trapesina and O. ohlini were available, resulting in fewer combinations of stressors tested. 

Controls for the temperature and salinity treatments were set at ambient levels of 35 plus or minus  0.1 ppt and 5.5 to 6 degreesC for all species. The lowered control temperature for the bivalve reflected the cooler seasonal temperatures at time of testing and lower position within the intertidal. Previous tests conducted under these ambient conditions provided information on the ranges of relevant copper concentrations, appropriate test durations, and water change regimes for each taxon (Holan et al., 2017, Holan et al., 2016b). From these previous studies, we determined that a test duration of 14 d was sometimes required with 7 d often being the best outcome for most species due to high control survival and sufficient response across concentrations. The bivalve G. trapesina was an exception to this due to unfavourable water quality after 3 days in previous work (Holan et al., 2016). For the other three species, this longer duration for acute tests, compared to tests with tropical and temperature species (24 to 96 h) was consistent with previous Antarctic studies that have required longer durations in order to elicit an acute response in biota (King and Riddle, 2001, Marcus Zamora et al., 2015, Sfiligoj et al., 2015). Experimental variables (volume of water, density of test organisms, copper concentrations, temperatures and salinities) differed for each experiment due to differences between each species (Table 1).  The temperature increases that were tested (2 to 4  degreesC) reflected the increased sea and air temperatures predicted for the region tested by 2100 (Collins et al., 2013).  

Treatments were prepared 24 h prior to the addition of animals. Seawater was filtered to 0.45 microns and water quality was measured using a TPS 90-FL multimeter at the start and end of tests. Dissolved oxygen was greater than 80% saturation and pH was 8.1 to 8.3 at the start of tests. All experimental vials and glassware were washed with 10% nitric acid and rinsed with MilliQ water three times before use. Salinity of test solutions was prepared by dilution through the addition of MilliQ water. Copper treatments using the filtered seawater at altered salinities were prepared using 500mg/L CuSO4 (Analytical grade, Univar) in MilliQ water stock solution.  Samples of test solutions for metal analysis by ICP-OES were taken at the start and end of tests (on days 0 and 14). Details of ICP-OES procedures are described in the Supplemental material (S4). Samples were taken using a 0.45 µm syringe filter that had been acid and Milli-Q rinsed. Samples were then acidified with 1% diluted ultra-pure nitric acid (65% Merck Suprapur).  Measured concentrations at the start of tests were within 96% of nominal concentrations.  In order to determine approximate exposure concentrations for each treatment, we averaged the 0 d and 14 d measured concentrations (Table 1). Tests were conducted in temperature controlled cabinets at a light intensity of 2360 lux. At the Macquarie Island station a light-dark regime of 16:8 h was used to mimic summer conditions. In the laboratories in Kingston, Australia, a 12:12 h regime was used to simulate Autum light conditions (as appropriate for the time of testing). Test individuals were slowly acclimated to treatment temperatures over 1 to 2 h before being added to treatments. Temperatures were monitored using Thermochron ibutton data loggers within the cabinets for the duration of the tests. 

Determination of mortality of individuals differed for each taxon. Mortality was recorded for Gaimardia trapesina when shells were open due to dysfunctional adductor muscles; for Obrimoposthia ohlini when individuals were inactive and covered in mucous; for Limnoria stephenseni when individuals were inactive after gentle stimulation with a stream of water from a pipette; and for Harpacticus sp. when urosomes were perpendicular to prosomes (as used in other studies with copepods; see Kwok and Leung, 2005). All dead individuals were removed from test vials.</description>

            <description type="brief">- Public Summary from Project -
Most of the snow falling on inland Antarctica drains via large ice streams and floating ice shelves to the sea where it lost by iceberg calving or as melt beneath the shelves.  Ocean interaction beneath the shelves is complicated, and regions of basal refreezing as well as melt occur.  These processes are important not only because they  are a major component of the Antarctic mass budget, but because they also modify the characteristics of the ocean, influencing the formation of Antarctic Bottom Water which plays a major role in the global ocean circulation.  The processes are sensitive to climate change, and shifts in ocean temperature or circulation near Antarctica could lead to the disappearance of all Antarctic ice shelves.

The Amery
Ice Shelf is the major embayed shelf in East Antarctica, and the subject of considerable previous ANARE investigation.  Ocean interaction processes occurring beneath the shelf are only poorly understood, and this project will directly measure water characteristics and circulation in the cavity underneath the ice shelf, and the rates of melt and freezing on the bottom of the shelf.  These measurements will be made through a number of access holes melted through the shelf.  The project is closely linked with other projects investigating the circulation and interactions in the open ocean to the north of the shelf, and studies of the ice shelf flow and mass budget.

Progress Against Objectives:
The work undertaken in the past 12 months has continued to relate chiefly to the first of our objectives - "quantify the characteristics and circulation of ocean water in the cavity beneath the Amery Ice Shelf". Data from the AMISOR project have provided the first record of a seasonal cycle of ice shelf-ocean interaction. After recovering the 2008 data we now have near-continuous oceanographic data from beneath the Amery at 3 different depths for 6, 6, 3, and 3 years from 4 different sites. Note that the instruments at AM01 and AM02 (6 annual cycles of data each) are no longer recording due to expiration of the onboard batteries (3-5 years expected life cycle). This allows us to investigate the "real" 3-D, seasonally varying, circulation and melt/freezing cycle beneath an ice shelf - rather than the steady state, simplified "2-D ice pump circulation" that has mostly been assumed previously.

As much as 80% of the continental ice that flows into the Amery Ice Shelf from the Lambert Glacier basin is lost as basal melt melt beneath the southern part of the shelf, but a considerable amount of ice is also frozen onto the base in the north-western part of the shelf. These processes of melt and refreezing are due to a pattern of water circulation beneath the ice shelf which is driven by sea ice formation outside the front of the shelf. Our multi-year data from 4 sites beneath the Amery ice shelf show that there is a very strong seasonal cycle in the characteristics of the ocean water beneath the shelf, and strong interseasonal variability in this. The seasonal cycle is driven mostly by the seasonal cycle of sea ice formation and decay in Prydz Bay, and interseasonal variations are due to differences in the general ocean circulation, and in particular the upwelling of Circumpolar Deep Water onto the continental shelf in Prydz Bay. The melt and freeze processes beneath the ice shelf, also themselves modify the water characteristics.

Taken from the 2009-2010 Progress Report:
The AMISOR project drilled two new 600 m deep boreholes on the Amery Ice Shelf in 2009-10: the first on the marine ice flowline to enhance understanding of the re-freezing process beneath the shelf; and the second in a region of known interest with respect to circulation patterns in the ocean cavity below the shelf. Instrument deployments at both sites should provide valuable annual cycle data over the next 4-5 years.</description>

            <description type="brief">The Tasman International Geospace Environment Radar (TIGER) is an over-the-horizon radar that locates ionospheric structures in the region between Tasmania and Antarctica, measuring their velocities. Compared with other similar (SuperDARN) radars, TIGER is uniquely sited to detect phenomena occurring in the region equatorward of the normal auroral oval. This project exploits this advantage to study the physical processes generating phenomena that are poorly understood, such as sub-auroral convection flows and the regeneration of the plasmapause after magnetic storms. Results are important for developing improved space weather predictions necessary, for example, for communications and satellite navigation systems.

The data comes in two forms DAT files and FIT files.  The FIT files are reasonably versatile, and smaller, and are stored online, but have not yet made them available outside IPS.

Data are available on request to IPS (Kehe Wang), and will be made available via FTP.

The radar has been operating since November 1999.
  
Project objectives: The project objectives, as stated in the project application round 2008/09, appear below:
The fundamental objective of the TIGER project is to study and understand, crucial outstanding problems in the physics of the outermost part of our environmental envelope (Geospace) - problems that are of scientific importance and fundamental to improving space weather predictions. The TIGER radar will be used to investigate:

1. the dynamics of the auroral oval;
2. sub-auroral convection flows;
3. the dynamics of the plasmapause during sub-storm activity;
4. coupling between the dayside and nightside of the magnetosphere;
5. generation of travelling ionospheric disturbances (TIDs) and their propagation to, and energy deposition at, mid-latitudes over Australia;
6. the development of reliable prediction/nowcasting techniques of real benefit to Australian HF users;
7. mesospheric winds;
8. the sea state.

TIGER will provide real-time data for:

1. mesospheric winds above the Southern Ocean region;
2. real-time maps of ionospheric convection in the southern hemisphere;
3. surface wind direction across the Southern Ocean.

An important new aspect of this proposal is the addition of the second TIGER radar, TIGER/Unwin, that is located near Invercargill, New Zealand, and which will begin operations late 2004. 

Taken from the 2008-2009 Progress Report:
Progress against objectives:
The TIGER radar at Bruny Island has operated continuously for over 95% of the time during the last year. Special campaigns are run for approximately one week each month during SuperDARN Discretionary Time periods, the remainder of the time TIGER operates in synchronism with all other SuperDARN radars during SuperDARN Common Time periods.

Data is now transferred via satellite from Bruny to the La Trobe TIGER data server. Data is still backed up on hard disk at the radar site until storage and backup on the TIGER server is confirmed.

During Discretionary time special campaign modes have been run to study PMSE, sea-state, micropulsations, and the scattering processes that generate the ionospheric echoes detected by the TIGER radars. Many of these campaigns have been coordinated with similar operations of the TIGER Unwin radar located in NZ and some used the phasing box that swings the TIGER Bruny radar footprint over Macquarie Island to give coincidence measurements with the ionosonde and magnetometer instruments at Macquarie Island.

For the 2008-09 summer, arrangements were again made for the all the southern hemisphere SuperDARN radars to operate a Common Time mode most suited to the detection of PMSE. This is particularly important for collaborative PMSE studies with the VHF radar and other instruments at Davis.

Several major research projects have been completed and the work published and presented at national and international scientific meetings. This includes projects conducted by other members of the TIGER consortium who are not investigators on this specific project.

In the past year results have been published or reported at conferences on the dynamics of the auroral oval; coupling from the nightside magnetosphere to aurora in the Harang discontinuity region, sub-auroral convection flows. Other science topics listed in the objectives have been studied and reported in previous years.

Public summary of the season progress
The Tasman International Geospace Environment Radar (TIGER) is a dual, over-the-horizon radar system that locates ionospheric structures, meteors and sea echoes in the region between Tasmania-NZ and Antarctica. In the last year observations of motions in the auroral and sub-auroral ionosphere have been used to study the evolution of space weather systems and to identify the causes of phenomena not previously understood. Results contribute to improving space weather predictions necessary, for example, to support communications, satellite navigation systems such as GPS and the Jindalee Over-The-Horizon Radar system that provides surveillance of Australia's coastline.</description>

            <description type="full">From the abstract of some of the papers:

It has been suggested that increased springtime UVB radiation caused by stratospheric ozone depletion is likely to reduce primary production and induce changes in the species composition of Antarctic marine phytoplankton. Experiments conducted at Arthur Harbour in the Antarctic Peninsula revealed a reduction in primary productivity at both ambient and increased levels of UVB.  Laboratory studies have shown that most species in culture are sensitive to high UVB levels, although the level at which either growth or photosynthesis is inhibited is variable.  Stratospheric ozone depletion, with resultant increased springtime UVB irradiance, has been occurring with increasing severity since the late 1970's.  Thus the phytoplankton community has already experienced about 20 years' exposure to increasing levels of UVB radiation.  Here we present analyses of diatom assemblages from high-resolution stratigraphic sequences from anoxic basins in fjords of the Vestfold HIlls, Antarctica.  We find that compositional changes in the diatom component of the phytoplankton community over the past 20 years cannot be distinguished from long-term natural variability, although there is some indication of a decline in the production of some sea-ice diatoms.  We anticipate that our results are applicable to other Antarctic coastal regions, where thick ice cover and the timing of the phytoplankton bloom protect the phytoplankton from the effects of increased UVB radiation.

Growth rate, survival, and stimulation of the production of UV-B (280 to 320 nm) absorbing compounds were investigated in cultures of five commonly occurring Antarctic marine diatoms exposed to a range of UV-B irradiances. Experimental UV-B exposures ranged from 20 to 650% of the measured peak surface irradiance at an Antarctic coastal site (0.533 J per square metre per second).  The five diatom species (Nitzschia lecointei, Proboscia alata, P. inermis, Thalassiosira tumida and Stellarima microtrias) appear capable of surviving two to four times this irradiance.  In contrast to Phaeocystis cf. pouchetti, another major component of the Antarctic phytoplankton, the concentrations of pigments with discrete UV absorption peaks in diatoms were low and did not change significantly under increasing UV-B irradiance. Absorbance of UV-B by cells from which pigments had been extracted commonly exceeded that of the pigments themselves.  Most of this absorbance was due to oxidisable cell contents, with the frustule providing the remainder.  Survival of diatoms did not correlate with absorption by either pigments, frustules or oxidisable cell contents, indicating that their survival under elevated UV-B irradiances results from processes other than screening mechanisms.

Springtime UV-B levels have been increasing in Antarctic marine ecosystems since the 1970's.  Effects on natural phytoplankton and sea-ice algal communities, however, remain unresolved.  At the Marginal Ice Edge Zone, enhanced springtime UV-B levels coincide with a shallow, stratified water column and a major phytoplankton bloom.  In these areas it is possible that phytoplankton growth and survival is adversely impacted by enhanced UV-B.  In coastal areas, however, the sea ice, which attenuates most of the UV-B before it reaches the water column, remains until December/January, by which time UV-B levels have returned to long-term seasonal averages.  Phytoplankton from these areas are unlikely to show long-term changes resulting from the hole in the ozone layer.  Fjords of the Vestfold Hills, eastern Antarctica, have anoxic basins which contain high-resolution, unbioturbated sedimentary sequences.  Diatom assemblages from these sequences reflect the diatom component of the phytoplankton and sea-ice algal assemblages at the time of deposition.  Twenty-year records from these sequences show no consistent record of change in species composition, diversity or species richness. Six-hundred-year records from the same area also show changes in species abundance greater than those seen in the last 20 years.  From these records it can be seen that recent changes in diatom abundances generally fall within the limits of natural variability and there is little evidence of recent changes that might be associated with UV-B-induced change.</description>

            <description type="full">Study location and test species
Subantarctic Macquarie Island lies in the Southern Ocean, just north of the Antarctic Convergence at 54 degrees 30' S, 158 degrees 57' E. Its climate is driven by oceanic processes, resulting in highly stable daily and inter-seasonal air and sea temperatures (Pendlebury and Barnes-Keoghan, 2007). Temperatures in intertidal rock pools (0.5 to 2 m deep) were logged with Thermochron ibuttons over two consecutive summers and averaged 6.5 (plus or minus 0.5)  degrees C. The island is relatively pristine and in many areas there has been no past exposure to contamination. To confirm sites used for invertebrate collections were free from metal contamination, seawater samples were taken and analysed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES; Varian 720-ES; S1)

The four invertebrate species used in this study were drawn from a range of taxa and ecological niches (Figure 1). The isopod Limnoria stephenseni was collected from floating fronds of the kelp Macrosystis pyrifera, which occurs several hundred meters offshore. The copepod Harpacticus sp. and bivalve Gaimardia trapesina were collected from algal species in the high energy shallow, subtidal zone. Finally, the flatworm Obrimoposthia ohlini was collected from the undersides of boulders throughout the intertidal zone. We hypothesised L. stephenseni would be particularly sensitive to changes in salinity and temperature due to its distribution in the deeper and relatively stable subtidal areas, while O. ohlini would be less sensitive due to its distribution high in the intertidal zone and exposure to naturally variable conditions.  We reasoned that the remaining two species, G. trapesina, and Harpacticus sp. were intermediate in the conditions to which they are naturally exposed and hence would likely be intermediate in their response. 

Test procedure
The combined effect of salinity, temperature and copper on biota was determined using a multi-factorial design. A range of copper concentrations were tested with each combination of temperatures and salinities, so that there were up to 9 copper toxicity tests simultaneously conducted per species (Table 1). Experiments on L. stephenseni and Harpacticus sp. were done on Macquarie Island within 2 to 3 days of collection, during which they were acclimated to laboratory conditions.  While, G. trapesina and O. ohlini were transported by ship to Australia in a recirculating aquarium system and maintained in a recirculating aquarium at the Australian Antarctic Division in Hobart, both at 6 degreesC. These two taxa were used in experiments within 3 months of their collection.  A limited number of G. trapesina and O. ohlini were available, resulting in fewer combinations of stressors tested. 

Controls for the temperature and salinity treatments were set at ambient levels of 35 plus or minus  0.1 ppt and 5.5 to 6 degreesC for all species. The lowered control temperature for the bivalve reflected the cooler seasonal temperatures at time of testing and lower position within the intertidal. Previous tests conducted under these ambient conditions provided information on the ranges of relevant copper concentrations, appropriate test durations, and water change regimes for each taxon (Holan et al., 2017, Holan et al., 2016b). From these previous studies, we determined that a test duration of 14 d was sometimes required with 7 d often being the best outcome for most species due to high control survival and sufficient response across concentrations. The bivalve G. trapesina was an exception to this due to unfavourable water quality after 3 days in previous work (Holan et al., 2016). For the other three species, this longer duration for acute tests, compared to tests with tropical and temperature species (24 to 96 h) was consistent with previous Antarctic studies that have required longer durations in order to elicit an acute response in biota (King and Riddle, 2001, Marcus Zamora et al., 2015, Sfiligoj et al., 2015). Experimental variables (volume of water, density of test organisms, copper concentrations, temperatures and salinities) differed for each experiment due to differences between each species (Table 1).  The temperature increases that were tested (2 to 4  degreesC) reflected the increased sea and air temperatures predicted for the region tested by 2100 (Collins et al., 2013).  

Treatments were prepared 24 h prior to the addition of animals. Seawater was filtered to 0.45 microns and water quality was measured using a TPS 90-FL multimeter at the start and end of tests. Dissolved oxygen was greater than 80% saturation and pH was 8.1 to 8.3 at the start of tests. All experimental vials and glassware were washed with 10% nitric acid and rinsed with MilliQ water three times before use. Salinity of test solutions was prepared by dilution through the addition of MilliQ water. Copper treatments using the filtered seawater at altered salinities were prepared using 500mg/L CuSO4 (Analytical grade, Univar) in MilliQ water stock solution.  Samples of test solutions for metal analysis by ICP-OES were taken at the start and end of tests (on days 0 and 14). Details of ICP-OES procedures are described in the Supplemental material (S4). Samples were taken using a 0.45 µm syringe filter that had been acid and Milli-Q rinsed. Samples were then acidified with 1% diluted ultra-pure nitric acid (65% Merck Suprapur).  Measured concentrations at the start of tests were within 96% of nominal concentrations.  In order to determine approximate exposure concentrations for each treatment, we averaged the 0 d and 14 d measured concentrations (Table 1). Tests were conducted in temperature controlled cabinets at a light intensity of 2360 lux. At the Macquarie Island station a light-dark regime of 16:8 h was used to mimic summer conditions. In the laboratories in Kingston, Australia, a 12:12 h regime was used to simulate Autum light conditions (as appropriate for the time of testing). Test individuals were slowly acclimated to treatment temperatures over 1 to 2 h before being added to treatments. Temperatures were monitored using Thermochron ibutton data loggers within the cabinets for the duration of the tests. 

Determination of mortality of individuals differed for each taxon. Mortality was recorded for Gaimardia trapesina when shells were open due to dysfunctional adductor muscles; for Obrimoposthia ohlini when individuals were inactive and covered in mucous; for Limnoria stephenseni when individuals were inactive after gentle stimulation with a stream of water from a pipette; and for Harpacticus sp. when urosomes were perpendicular to prosomes (as used in other studies with copepods; see Kwok and Leung, 2005). All dead individuals were removed from test vials.</description>

            <description type="full">== Public Summary from Project ==
Most of the snow falling on inland Antarctica drains via large ice streams and floating ice shelves to the sea where it lost by iceberg calving or as melt beneath the shelves.  Ocean interaction beneath the shelves is complicated, and regions of basal refreezing as well as melt occur.  These processes are important not only because they  are a major component of the Antarctic mass budget, but because they also modify the characteristics of the ocean, influencing the formation of Antarctic Bottom Water which plays a major role in the global ocean circulation.  The processes are sensitive to climate change, and shifts in ocean temperature or circulation near Antarctica could lead to the disappearance of all Antarctic ice shelves.

The Amery
Ice Shelf is the major embayed shelf in East Antarctica, and the subject of considerable previous ANARE investigation.  Ocean interaction processes occurring beneath the shelf are only poorly understood, and this project will directly measure water characteristics and circulation in the cavity underneath the ice shelf, and the rates of melt and freezing on the bottom of the shelf.  These measurements will be made through a number of access holes melted through the shelf.  The project is closely linked with other projects investigating the circulation and interactions in the open ocean to the north of the shelf, and studies of the ice shelf flow and mass budget.

AM01 and AM01 b boreholes
* CTD profiles through water column
* CTD annual records at selected depths
* Ocean current profiles through water column

Taken from the 2008-2009 Progress Report:
Progress Against Objectives:
The work undertaken in the past 12 months has continued to relate chiefly to the first of our objectives - "quantify the characteristics and circulation of ocean water in the cavity beneath the Amery Ice Shelf". Data from the AMISOR project have provided the first record of a seasonal cycle of ice shelf-ocean interaction. After recovering the 2008 data we now have near-continuous oceanographic data from beneath the Amery at 3 different depths for 6, 6, 3, and 3 years from 4 different sites. Note that the instruments at AM01 and AM02 (6 annual cycles of data each) are no longer recording due to expiration of the onboard batteries (3-5 years expected life cycle). This allows us to investigate the "real" 3-D, seasonally varying, circulation and melt/freezing cycle beneath an ice shelf - rather than the steady state, simplified "2-D ice pump circulation" that has mostly been assumed previously.

As much as 80% of the continental ice that flows into the Amery Ice Shelf from the Lambert Glacier basin is lost as basal melt melt beneath the southern part of the shelf, but a considerable amount of ice is also frozen onto the base in the north-western part of the shelf. These processes of melt and refreezing are due to a pattern of water circulation beneath the ice shelf which is driven by sea ice formation outside the front of the shelf. Our multi-year data from 4 sites beneath the Amery ice shelf show that there is a very strong seasonal cycle in the characteristics of the ocean water beneath the shelf, and strong interseasonal variability in this. The seasonal cycle is driven mostly by the seasonal cycle of sea ice formation and decay in Prydz Bay, and interseasonal variations are due to differences in the general ocean circulation, and in particular the upwelling of Circumpolar Deep Water onto the continental shelf in Prydz Bay. The melt and freeze processes beneath the ice shelf, also themselves modify the water characteristics.

Taken from the 2009-2010 Progress Report:
The AMISOR project drilled two new 600 m deep boreholes on the Amery Ice Shelf in 2009-10: the first on the marine ice flowline to enhance understanding of the re-freezing process beneath the shelf; and the second in a region of known interest with respect to circulation patterns in the ocean cavity below the shelf. Instrument deployments at both sites should provide valuable annual cycle data over the next 4-5 years.</description>

            <description type="full">A hierarchical, 3-level, nested design was used. The highest hierarchical level consisted of six locations. Two of these locations, Brown Bay and Shannon Bay, have been contaminated with heavy metals (Stark et al., 2003; Snape et al., 2001); Brown Bay has also been contaminated with petroleum hydrocarbons (Snape et al., 2001). The remaining four locations are more distant from Casey Station and were used as control locations. These locations were Denison Island, Odbert Island, O'Brien Bay and Sparkes Bay. A full description of these sites is given below.

Within each location two sites were selected approximately 100 m apart. Within each site, two plots were sampled (~ 10 m apart). Although the sampling program had been designed for four replicates within each plot, the patchy distribution of bottom sediments in the Windmill Islands restricted this to two replicate samples (~ 1 m apart) per plot. Samples were collected using an Eckman grab sampler, deployed from a boat. To minimise the potential influence of water depth, all samples were collected from 8 m water depth. Samples were collected within a three day period in early February when no sea-ice was present.

Diatom data are presented as the relative abundances of benthic species. Samples are identified xyz where x = first initial of sample location (or first 2 initials where 2 locations start with the same letter), y = plot number (plots 1 and 2 represent site 1, while plots 3 and 4 are from site 2), and z = replicate number (a or b).  Abbreviations used for species are shown in the separate file sp_list.

This work was completed as part of ASAC project 1130 (ASAC_1130) and project 2201 (ASAC_2201).

Public summary from project 1130:

Algal mats grow on sea floor in most shallow marine environments.  They are thought to contribute more than half of the total primary production in many of these areas, making them a critical food source for invertebrates and some fish.  We will establish how important they are in Antarctic marine environments and determine the effects of local sewerage and tip site pollution.  We will also investigate the impact on the algal mats of the additional UV radiation which results from the ozone hole.

Public summary from project 2201:

As a signatory to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty Australia is committed to comprehensive protection of the Antarctic environment. This protocol requires that activities in the Antarctic shall be planned and conducted on the basis of information sufficient to make prior assessments of, and informed judgements about, their possible impacts on the Antarctic environment. Most of our activities in the Antarctic occur along the narrow fringe of ice-free rock adjacent to the sea and many of our activities have the potential to cause environmental harm to marine life. The Antarctic seas support the most complex and biologically diverse plant and animal communities of the region. However, very little is known about them and there is certainly not sufficient known to make informed judgements about possible environmental impacts


The animals and plants of the sea-bed are widely accepted as being the most appropriate part of the marine ecosystem for indicating disturbance caused by local sources. Attached sea-bed organisms have a fixed spatial relationship with a given place so they must either endure conditions or die. Once lost from a site recolonisation takes some time, as a consequence the structure of sea-bed communities reflect not only present conditions but they can also integrate conditions in the past. In contrast, fish and planktonic organisms can move freely so their site of capture does not indicate a long residence time at that location. Because sea-bed communities are particularly diverse they contain species with widely differing life strategies, as a result different species can have very different levels of tolerance to stress; this leads to a range of subtle changes in community structure as a response to gradually increasing disturbance, rather than an all or nothing response.

This project will examine sea-bed communities near our stations to determine how seriously they are affected by human activities. This information will be used to set priorities for improving operational procedures to reduce the risk of further environmental damage.

            <description type="full">A sediment core was collected from the western side of Pidgeon Island, (66.3216 S, 110.445 E) at a water depth of 82.0 m.  This sediment core (PG 1411-2) was recovered using a release-controlled piston corer, with a length of 3 m, using the coring technique described in Melles et al., (1994). The total core length was 240 cm.  This core was stored in the dark, at 0  degrees C until required.  Samples were taken for diatom analyses and  radiocarbon (14C) dating.  Prior to sub-sampling the core was split in half,  along its length. One half was used for sampling, the other kept intact and  stored at IASOS (University of Tasmania).  To reduce potential contamination,  resulting from the disturbance of sediments during the core-splitting  procedure, a thin layer of sediment was removed from the exposed surface  immediately prior to sampling.

In order to obtain samples for diatom analysis, a toothpick was inserted into the core segment, and used to gouge a small amount of sediment from the middle of the core.  Samples for diatom analyses were initially collected every 5 mm, however, sampling frequency progressively decreased down the core.  Samples for radiocarbon data consisted of at least 1 cm 3 of sediment, collected from the middle of the core.  These samples were collected from between 0-1 cm, 12-13 cm, 59-60 cm, 77-78 cm, 117-118 cm, and 229-230 cm depth.

Diatom data are presented as raw counts, benthic abundances, the ratio of benthic to plankton species, and as the benthic index.  Calculated ages (in years) are also given for all samples.  The sedimentological core log is given as a powerpoint presentation.

This work was completed as part of ASAC project 1130 (ASAC_1130) and project 2201 (ASAC_2201).

            <description type="brief">This dataset consists of different possible land use configurations along the Great Barrier Reef coastal zone for the future (year 2035) under eight different scenarios (plausible futures). Scenarios are not predictions and do not intend to show what the coastal zone will look like (this is impossible as the future of coastal development I highly uncertain, even on a short term basis, let alone 25 years). Instead, scenarios are used to depict some plausible futures under certain circumstances so that managers can understand the system better and the various ways the future might unfold. Scenarios are built to broaden the extremities of possibilities in order to assert the main differences. The scenarios are then used to conduct impact assessments and this helps managers better understand the connections between land spatial planning and the effects on the values of the GBR World Heritage Area. The results can also be incorporated in the process for spatial planning of coastal development.

These scenarios were built using workshops and literature reviews and are based on different combinations of socio-economic factors driving the amount of change of the different land uses and of strength of governance systems (strong or weak). Figure 1 contains summaries of the storylines of the scenarios. These were translated in quantitative and spatial rules of change for land uses (transition matrix of land use change were created for each scenario and GIS layers were created for each spatial rule later combined to fit each scenario). The land use change modelling took several steps, all conducting the IDRISI Land Use Change Modeler. The first stage was to establish the best bio-physical predictors of change in land use. This was done using [see Bio-physical predictors of coastal Land use change between 1999 and 2009]. The outputs were transition probability maps for each change between one land use to another. The second stage was to use these transition probability maps, the quantitative matrices of change and the spatial rule layers to assign change and produce land use change configurations (the scenarios) to 2035.

The modelling of the land use change was done at a 50m pixel scale. This was however aggregated to a resolution of 500m as presented here to ensure that the dataset is not seen as an accurate set of maps. The “predictive” power of change of the system is not expected to be accurate at the scale of 50m as the land use changes are applied in a probabilistic manner. As a result new allocated land may follow random pattern at the small scale and so the shape of the new areas do not necessarily have a structure that is natural for each land use type. An example of this is that in reality new residential developments tend to be rectangular in shape. However transitions to residential areas in the model tend to be scattered. To get around the excessive precision of the model this final dataset is aggregated to a resolution of 500m, where each pixel corresponds to the majority land use for that area.


Format:

The following rasters (GRID format) constitute the dataset of the spatially-explicit scenarios. They each represent land use maps for the terrestrial part of the Great Barrier Reef coastal zone in the past in 1999 (QLUMP data) and in 2009 (QLUMP data) and in the 8 scenarios produced as part of the NERP 9.4 project. See Figure 1 for detail of scenarios.

1999 : QLUMP 1999 data
2009 : QLUMP 2009 data
AWG : Scenario As We Go (Business as usual in weak governance)
EM : Scenario Export Management (Food and Minerals in strong governance)
ER : Scenario Eco-Revolution (Green in strong governance)
GW : Green Washing (Green in weak governance)
RTC : Red Tape Cutting (Food and Minerals in weak governance)
TH : Tourism Heaven (Tourism in strong governance)
TOT : Twist on Trend (Business as Usual in strong governance)
WFR : Way For Resorts (Tourism in weak governance)

The classification of all rasters is as follow:
PIXEL VALUE | PIXEL CLASS | NOTES
1 | Ocean | Not coastal zone
2 | Land | Not coastal zone
3 | Waterstorage | Human-made water storage (lakes/reservoirs)
4 | Water | Rivers, lakes estuaries etc
5 | Others | Mainly natural vegetation with grazing 
6 | Conservation | Areas protected under IUCM status up to level IV
7 | Defence | Land with no entry permitted held by the Armies
8 | Forestry | Commercial plantations for timber
9 | IrrigS | Sugar cane fields requiring irrigation
10 | IntAnim | Indoor or improved pastures for high-density animal farms
11 | DryH | Crops, orchards, nut plantations, cotton with no irrigation
12 | DryS | Sugar cane fields with no irrigation
13 | IrrigH | Crops, orchards, nut plantations, cotton requiring irrigation
14 | Aquaculture | Land-based only
15 | Tourism | Areas built-up or used for tourism purposes
16 | Ports | Areas of commercial port infrastructure  
17 | Mining | Areas under mining and related infrastructures
18 | Urban | Residential, retail and industrial areas (cities, towns)

Part of the dataset includes a symbology layer filer that will automatically format the display in the best format for visualisation.

            <description type="brief">This dataset corresponds to a reformatting of the SRTM30_PLUS digital elevation dataset from 33 NetCDF files into a single GeoTiff for use in GIS applications. No other modifications to the data were done. The rest of this metadata describes the original SRTM30_PLUS dataset itself.

This dataset is a 30-arc second resolution global topography/bathymetry grid (SRTM30_PLUS) developed from a wide variety of data sources. Land and ice topography comes from the SRTM30 and ICESat topography, respectively. Ocean bathymetry is based on a new satellite-gravity model where the gravity-to-topography ratio is calibrated using 298 million edited soundings. The main contribution of this dataset is the compilation and editing of the raw soundings, which come from NOAA, individual scientists, SIO, NGA, JAMSTEC, IFREMER, GEBCO, and NAVOCEANO.

The SRTM30_PLUS dataset developed by Scripps Institute Of Oceanography, University of California San Diego (UCSD). 

Land data are based on the 1-km averages of topography derived from the USGS SRTM30 grided DEM data product created with data from the NASA Shuttle Radar Topography Mission. GTOPO30 data are used for high latitudes where SRTM data are not available.

Ocean data are based on the Smith and Sandwell global 1-minute grid between latitudes +/- 81 degrees. Higher resolution grids have been added from the LDEO Ridge Multibeam Synthesis Project, the JAMSTEC Data Site for Research Cruises, and the NGDC Coastal Relief Model. Arctic bathymetry is from the International Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans (IBCAO) [Jakobsson et al., 2003].  

This data consists of 33 files of global topography in the same format as the SRTM30 products distributed by the USGS EROS data center. The grid resolution is 30 second which is roughly one kilometer. In addition the global data are also available in a single large file ready for GMT and as 33 NetCDF files. The eAtlas has also merged and formatted the data as a single GeoTiff file with overviews (1.6 GB).

The pixel-registered data are stored in 33 files with names corresponding to the upper left corner of the array shown below. The data are also merged into a single large (1.9 Gbyte, 2-byte integer) file as well as smaller 1-minute and 2-minute netcdf versions. Matching files of source identification number are available for determining the data source for every pixel.

This new version (v8.0) includes all of the multibeam bathymetry data collected by U.S. research vessels over the past three decades including 287 Scripps expeditions from research vessels Washington, Melville and Revelle. UCSD undergraduate student Alexis Shakas processed all the U.S. multibeam data and then worked with Google researchers on the global integration.

The data is available from UCSD FTP server as 33 NetCDF files and from the eAtlas as a merged GeoTiff.

eAtlas Processing:

A set of Batch scripts were developed to perform the conversion of the data from NetCDF to GeoTiff and the generation of the hillshading. This processing was based on the GDAL command line tools. Full details of the processing can be found in the downloadable Scripts associated with this dataset.

Higher resolution grids have been added from the LDEO Ridge Multibeam Synthesis Project, the JAMSTEC Data Site for Research Cruises, and the NGDC Coastal Relief Model. Arctic bathymetry is from the International Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans (IBCAO) [Jakobsson et al., 2003].  

This data consists of 33 files of global topography in the same format as the SRTM30 products distributed by the USGS EROS data center. The grid resolution is 30 second which is roughly one kilometer. In addition the global data are also available in a single large file ready for GMT and as 33 NetCDF files. The eAtlas has also merged and formatted the data as a single GeoTiff file with overviews (1.6 GB).

The pixel-registered data are stored in 33 files with names corresponding to the upper left corner of the array shown below. The data are also merged into a single large (1.9 Gbyte, 2-byte integer) file as well as smaller 1-minute and 2-minute netcdf versions. Matching files of source identification number are available for determining the data source for every pixel.

This new version (v8.0) includes all of the multibeam bathymetry data collected by U.S. research vessels over the past three decades including 287 Scripps expeditions from research vessels Washington, Melville and Revelle. UCSD undergraduate student Alexis Shakas processed all the U.S. multibeam data and then worked with Google researchers on the global integration.

The data is available from UCSD FTP server as 33 NetCDF files and from the eAtlas as a merged GeoTiff.

eAtlas Processing:

A set of Batch scripts were developed to perform the conversion of the data from NetCDF to GeoTiff and the generation of the hillshading. This processing was based on the GDAL command line tools. Full details of the processing can be found in the downloadable Scripts associated with this dataset.

            <description type="full">Geoscience Australia undertook a marine survey of the Vlaming Sub-basin in March and April 2012 to provide seabed and shallow geological information to support an assessment of the CO2 storage potential of this sedimentary basin. The survey was undertaken under the Australian Government's National CO2 Infrastructure Plan (NCIP) to help identify sites suitable for the long term storage of CO2 within reasonable distances of major sources of CO2 emissions. The Vlaming Sub-basin is located offshore from Perth, Western Australia, and was previously identified by the Carbon Storage Taskforce (2009) as potentially suitable for CO2 storage. The principal aim of the Vlaming Sub-basin marine survey (GA survey number GA0334) was to look for evidence of fault reactivation and of any past or current gas or fluid seepage at the seabed. The survey also mapped seabed habitats and biota in the areas of interest to provide information on communities and biophysical features that may be associated with seepage.

            <description type="brief">HyVista Corporation was contracted by AIMS to acquire hyperspectral data over Ningaloo Marine Park in Western Australia. A total of 67 HyMap image strips were acquired, within 11 individual Blocks (A-K), between the 20th of April and the 2nd of May, 2006. The HyMap data products that have been delivered are radiance, reflectance and geocorrected data. 
 
The data acquisition was conducted in individual blocks. Each HyMap data block was acquired in one sortie and whenever possible HyVista tried to fly more then one block in one day. Due to survey time restrictions, Block F was acquired on two different days to allow for optimal sun angles. The HyMap survey was planned to cover the water areas to the 20m bathymetry line. Two blocks (G and F) cover it all the way to the 50m line. The survey was also extended to cover the Muiron Islands and the land area past Exmouth town. The area covered total 3400 square kilometers collected at 3.5m pixel size. 
 
Derived bathymetry and habitat models. 

  The HyMap sensor is an airborne imaging system that is used for earth resources remote sensing. It records a digital image of the earth's sunlit surface underneath the aircraft but unlike standard aerial cameras, the HyMap records images in a large number of wavelengths. In essence, the HyMap is an airborne spectrometer and like spectrometers used in analytical chemistry, it can detect and identify materials by the spectral features contained in the recorded data. 
 
The HyMap records an image of the earth's surface by using a rotating scan mirror which allows the image to build line by line as the aircraft flies forward. The reflected sunlight collected by the scan mirror is then dispersed into different wavelengths by four spectrometers in the system. The spectral and image information from the spectrometers is digitized and recorded on tape. 
 
The HyMap sensor utilizes four 32-element detector arrays (1 Si, 3 liquid-nitrogen cooled InSb) to provide 126 spectral channels covering the 450nm to 2500nm spectral range over a 512 pixel swath. 
 
To minimize distortion induced in the image by aircraft pitch, roll and yaw motions, the HyMap is mounted in a gyro-stabilized platform (Zeiss SM2000). While the platform minimizes the effects of aircraft motion, small image distortions remain. These residual motions are monitored with a 3 axis gyro, 3 axis accelerometer system (IMU-inertial monitoring unit). The system currently used with the HyMap is a Boeing C-MIGITS II. 
 
Associated with the actual HyMap optical system is an electronics sub-system which is rack mounted in the aircraft. This electronics sub-system provides the sensor with power and contains a computer system that controls the data acquisition process. There is a touch screen monitor used by the operator to set data acquisition parameters, start and stop recording, view the image as it is being acquired and review various engineering status indicators (power, temperature etc). 
 
The HyMap system has been designed to operate in aircraft that have standard aerial photo-ports. The angular width of the recorded image is 61.3 degrees or about 2.3 km when operating 2000m above ground level. Typically, the spatial resolution achieved with the HyMap is in the range 3 to 10 m. For the Ningaloo survey (3.5 m pixel size) the average survey altitude was about 1400m-1500m above ground with a swath width of 1.8 km.</description>

            <description type="lineage">Statement: The pixel size for the survey was nominated to be acquired at a size of 3.5m. Due to differences in ground speed of the aircraft, the actual pixel size may not be perfectly 3.5 during data acquisition. However during pre-processing all the geo located files are re-sampled to a 3.5 m pixel size and spacing.  
 
During a number of days of the survey and especially the last three days, the aircraft encountered extreme mechanical turbulence due to shear zones occurring at the flight altitudes over the land water boundary. This long term exposure to extreme vibration affected the liquid nitrogen cooled detector assembly (some internal structural parts were shaken loose) and resulted in some signal artifacts being introduced into the imagery. Most affected was the NIR spectrometer module. The VIS module, from which most of the reef mapping results will be derived, was unaffected.

Statement: The 8 bit GeoTiff images are derived from the geospec mosaic images for each block. A reasonable colour mapping of the three bands in these images was applied and the images saved as 8 bit with colour table GeoTiff images. The 8 bit GeoTiff images can be opened in most image display programs and can be imported into OziExplorer. The colour range is limited and some loss of feature definition has occurred compared with the original 3 band 16 bit/band images.

Statement: The 24 bit GeoTiff images are derived from the geospec mosaic images for each block. The data is identical to the .img files in that it is three bands of visible data (channels 15, 9, 3) stored as 16 bit integers. These images will not normally be viewable using simple image display software. Some GIS or image analysis software will be required to open them. They contain much more spectral information than the 8 bit GeoTiff files. The spatial resolution is the same. These files can be enhanced by altering the scaling of the individual bands whereas the 8 bit data has the colour mapping fixed.

A total of 67 HyMap image strips were acquired, within 11 individual Blocks (A-K), between the 20th of April and the 2nd of May, 2006. The HyMap data products that have been delivered are radiance, reflectance and geocorrected data. 
 
The data acquisition was conducted in individual blocks. Each HyMap data block was acquired in one sortie and whenever possible HyVista tried to fly more then one block in one day. Due to survey time restrictions, Block F was acquired on two different days to allow for optimal sun angles. The HyMap survey was planned to cover the water areas to the 20m bathymetry line. Two blocks (G and F) cover it all the way to the 50m line. The survey was also extended to cover the Muiron Islands and the land area past Exmouth town. The area covered total 3400 square kilometers collected at 3.5m pixel size. 
 
Derived bathymetry and habitat models. 

  The HyMap sensor is an airborne imaging system that is used for earth resources remote sensing. It records a digital image of the earth's sunlit surface underneath the aircraft but unlike standard aerial cameras, the HyMap records images in a large number of wavelengths. In essence, the HyMap is an airborne spectrometer and like spectrometers used in analytical chemistry, it can detect and identify materials by the spectral features contained in the recorded data. 
 
The HyMap records an image of the earth's surface by using a rotating scan mirror which allows the image to build line by line as the aircraft flies forward. The reflected sunlight collected by the scan mirror is then dispersed into different wavelengths by four spectrometers in the system. The spectral and image information from the spectrometers is digitized and recorded on tape. 
 
The HyMap sensor utilizes four 32-element detector arrays (1 Si, 3 liquid-nitrogen cooled InSb) to provide 126 spectral channels covering the 450nm to 2500nm spectral range over a 512 pixel swath. 
 
To minimize distortion induced in the image by aircraft pitch, roll and yaw motions, the HyMap is mounted in a gyro-stabilized platform (Zeiss SM2000). While the platform minimizes the effects of aircraft motion, small image distortions remain. These residual motions are monitored with a 3 axis gyro, 3 axis accelerometer system (IMU-inertial monitoring unit). The system currently used with the HyMap is a Boeing C-MIGITS II. 
 
Associated with the actual HyMap optical system is an electronics sub-system which is rack mounted in the aircraft. This electronics sub-system provides the sensor with power and contains a computer system that controls the data acquisition process. There is a touch screen monitor used by the operator to set data acquisition parameters, start and stop recording, view the image as it is being acquired and review various engineering status indicators (power, temperature etc). 
 
The HyMap system has been designed to operate in aircraft that have standard aerial photo-ports. The angular width of the recorded image is 61.3 degrees or about 2.3 km when operating 2000m above ground level. Typically, the spatial resolution achieved with the HyMap is in the range 3 to 10 m. For the Ningaloo survey (3.5 m pixel size) the average survey altitude was about 1400m-1500m above ground with a swath width of 1.8 km.</description>

            <description type="lineage">Statement: The pixel size for the survey was nominated to be acquired at a size of 3.5m. Due to differences in ground speed of the aircraft, the actual pixel size may not be perfectly 3.5 during data acquisition. However during pre-processing all the geo located files are re-sampled to a 3.5 m pixel size and spacing.  
 
During a number of days of the survey and especially the last three days, the aircraft encountered extreme mechanical turbulence due to shear zones occurring at the flight altitudes over the land water boundary. This long term exposure to extreme vibration affected the liquid nitrogen cooled detector assembly (some internal structural parts were shaken loose) and resulted in some signal artifacts being introduced into the imagery. Most affected was the NIR spectrometer module. The VIS module, from which most of the reef mapping results will be derived, was unaffected.

Statement: The 8 bit GeoTiff images are derived from the geospec mosaic images for each block. A reasonable colour mapping of the three bands in these images was applied and the images saved as 8 bit with colour table GeoTiff images. The 8 bit GeoTiff images can be opened in most image display programs and can be imported into OziExplorer. The colour range is limited and some loss of feature definition has occurred compared with the original 3 band 16 bit/band images.

Statement: The 24 bit GeoTiff images are derived from the geospec mosaic images for each block. The data is identical to the .img files in that it is three bands of visible data (channels 15, 9, 3) stored as 16 bit integers. These images will not normally be viewable using simple image display software. Some GIS or image analysis software will be required to open them. They contain much more spectral information than the 8 bit GeoTiff files. The spatial resolution is the same. These files can be enhanced by altering the scaling of the individual bands whereas the 8 bit data has the colour mapping fixed.

            <description type="brief">Massive Porites colonies were collected from 1 reef in the Coral Sea and 29 reefs located along the length and across the width of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), between November 1987 and May 1992. The reefs were located within the following regions: Northern Coral Sea (Ashmore Reef); Northern GBR (Lagoon Reef, Eel Reef, Portland Roads, Rocky Island, Night Island, Reef No. 13-055 and Reef No. 13-050); Cairns to Cape Melville (Tydeman Reef, Pipon Island, Flinders Island, Watson Island, South Petherbridge Island, Two Isles, Boulder Reef, East Hope Island, Undine Reef, Snapper Island, Batt Reef, and Double Island); Mission Beach (Stephens Island and Bedarra Island); Central GBR (Myrmidon Reef, Rib Reef and Pandora Reef); Southern GBR (Shaw Island, Reef No. 20-200, Credlin Reef, Reef No. 21-141 and Middle Percy Island). All colonies were between 0.2 and 0.5 m in height and were selected from similar environments towards the rear of the windward reef flat or on sheltered parts of fringing reefs in the lee of the islands at depths between 3 and 5 m relative to mean low water spring tide levels. Between six and 15 colonies were collected from each site and 232 similar sized colonies were used for luminescence analysis. The species of coral colonies analysed were: Porites lutea, Porites lobata, Porites australensis, Porites solida and Porites mayeri.Colonies were cut in half vertically and at least 2 slices, approximately 7mm thick, were cut from the centre of each colony. Coral growth characteristics had been recorded from these slices using X-ray and densitometry in a previous study and slices were dated using the annual density banding patterns and gamma density traces. Each dated year represents the time between successive density peaks.Slices were viewed under UV light in a darkened room. Luminescence was assessed along 2 tracks close to the vertical growth axis and 1 horizontal track. For each slice and year the appearance of the luminescent lines was graded visually into one of four categories: 0 = no visible line, 1 = faint luminescent line, 2 = moderate luminescent line and 3 = intense luminescent line. A luminescence index was derived for each year that 2 or more colonies from the same reef were analysed. The index for a particular year and reef was the sum of the number of luminescent lines in each category multiplied by the value of that category, divided by the total number of colonies.Daily river flows were obtained from the Queensland Department of Natural Resources for the 9 major rivers that drain into the GBR lagoon: Normanby River, Daintree River, Barron River, North Johnstone River, South Johnstone River, Tully River, Herbert River, Burdekin River and Fitzroy River.A 3-D hydrodynamic model of the movement of freshwater river plumes from the Burdekin River was used to provide daily salinity variations at Rib and Pandora Reefs for the period 1966-1986. Measures of salinity derived for each reef were: average annual salinity; minimum daily salinity; number of days with salinity &amp;lt; 35 ppt; sum of daily salinity values &amp;lt; 35 ppt; and average of daily salinities &amp;lt; 35 ppt. Reefs were classified as inshore, midshelf and offshore. In addition, the linear distance (km) between each reef and the nearest mainland was estimated and expressed as a percentage of the shelf width at that latitude. The average water depth between each reef and the nearest point on the mainland was calculated from depths at taken at approximately 225 m intervals from a bathymetry data model for the GBR. 

  This study was undertaken to determine:1. if luminescent signals in corals are reproducible2. how far offshore luminescent lines are evident and if there is a relationship between intensity of luminescence and distance from shore3. how often are reefs affected by freshwater4. if past flows for rivers other than the Burdekin can be reconstructed from luminescent lines in massive corals5. if luminescent lines in corals from the central GBR match 3-D modeling of salinities associated with the Burdekin River plume. 

  These colonies (with the exception of those collected from Ashmore Reef) were initially collected to determine variations in growth characteristics in massive corals with environmental gradients.See Metadata Record: Environmental controls on growth of massive Porites corals from the Great Barrier Reef</description>

            <description type="brief">Massive Porites colonies were collected from 1 reef in the Coral Sea and 29 reefs located along the length and across the width of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), between November 1987 and May 1992. The reefs were located within the following regions: Northern Coral Sea (Ashmore Reef); Northern GBR (Lagoon Reef, Eel Reef, Portland Roads, Rocky Island, Night Island, Reef No. 13-055 and Reef No. 13-050); Cairns to Cape Melville (Tydeman Reef, Pipon Island, Flinders Island, Watson Island, South Petherbridge Island, Two Isles, Boulder Reef, East Hope Island, Undine Reef, Snapper Island, Batt Reef, and Double Island); Mission Beach (Stephens Island and Bedarra Island); Central GBR (Myrmidon Reef, Rib Reef and Pandora Reef); Southern GBR (Shaw Island, Reef No. 20-200, Credlin Reef, Reef No. 21-141 and Middle Percy Island). All colonies were between 0.2 and 0.5 m in height and were selected from similar environments towards the rear of the windward reef flat or on sheltered parts of fringing reefs in the lee of the islands at depths between 3 and 5 m relative to mean low water spring tide levels. Between six and 15 colonies were collected from each site and 232 similar sized colonies were used for luminescence analysis. The species of coral colonies analysed were: Porites lutea, Porites lobata, Porites australensis, Porites solida and Porites mayeri.Colonies were cut in half vertically and at least 2 slices, approximately 7mm thick, were cut from the centre of each colony. Coral growth characteristics had been recorded from these slices using X-ray and densitometry in a previous study and slices were dated using the annual density banding patterns and gamma density traces. Each dated year represents the time between successive density peaks.Slices were viewed under UV light in a darkened room. Luminescence was assessed along 2 tracks close to the vertical growth axis and 1 horizontal track. For each slice and year the appearance of the luminescent lines was graded visually into one of four categories: 0 = no visible line, 1 = faint luminescent line, 2 = moderate luminescent line and 3 = intense luminescent line. A luminescence index was derived for each year that 2 or more colonies from the same reef were analysed. The index for a particular year and reef was the sum of the number of luminescent lines in each category multiplied by the value of that category, divided by the total number of colonies.Daily river flows were obtained from the Queensland Department of Natural Resources for the 9 major rivers that drain into the GBR lagoon: Normanby River, Daintree River, Barron River, North Johnstone River, South Johnstone River, Tully River, Herbert River, Burdekin River and Fitzroy River.A 3-D hydrodynamic model of the movement of freshwater river plumes from the Burdekin River was used to provide daily salinity variations at Rib and Pandora Reefs for the period 1966-1986. Measures of salinity derived for each reef were: average annual salinity; minimum daily salinity; number of days with salinity &amp;lt; 35 ppt; sum of daily salinity values &amp;lt; 35 ppt; and average of daily salinities &amp;lt; 35 ppt. Reefs were classified as inshore, midshelf and offshore. In addition, the linear distance (km) between each reef and the nearest mainland was estimated and expressed as a percentage of the shelf width at that latitude. The average water depth between each reef and the nearest point on the mainland was calculated from depths at taken at approximately 225 m intervals from a bathymetry data model for the GBR. 

  This study was undertaken to determine:1. if luminescent signals in corals are reproducible2. how far offshore luminescent lines are evident and if there is a relationship between intensity of luminescence and distance from shore3. how often are reefs affected by freshwater4. if past flows for rivers other than the Burdekin can be reconstructed from luminescent lines in massive corals5. if luminescent lines in corals from the central GBR match 3-D modeling of salinities associated with the Burdekin River plume. 

  These colonies (with the exception of those collected from Ashmore Reef) were initially collected to determine variations in growth characteristics in massive corals with environmental gradients.See Metadata Record: Environmental controls on growth of massive Porites corals from the Great Barrier Reef</description>

            <description type="brief">This dataset consists of rasters representing downscaled climate change scenarios (8 km resolution) for the Torres Strait and Papua New Guinea regions for 1990, 2055, 2090. This includes estimated mean surface relative humidity (%), wind speed, rainfall rate (mm per day) and surface temperature (degrees Celsius) estimated from simulated conditions for 1980?1999, 2046-2065 and 2080?2099 time periods. Also included is the relative change of each attribute with respect to 1990.

For the past decade the Conformal Cubic Atmospheric Model (CCAM) has been the mainstay of CSIRO dynamical downscaling (McGregor 1996, 2005a, 2005b; McGregor and Dix 2001, 2008). CCAM is an atmospheric GCM formulated on the conformal-cubic grid. CCAM includes a fairly comprehensive set of physical parameterizations. The GFDL parameterizations for long-wave and short-wave radiation (Schwarzkopf and Fels 1991; Lacis and Hansen 1974) are employed, with interactive cloud distributions determined by the liquid and ice-water scheme of Rotstayn (1997). The model employs a stability-dependent boundary layer scheme based on Monin-Obukhov similarity theory (McGregor et al. 1993), together with the non-local treatment of Holtslag and Boville (1993). A canopy scheme is included, as described by Kowalczyk et al. (1994), having six layers for soil temperatures, six layers for soil moisture (solving Richard's equation) and three layers for snow. The cumulus convection scheme uses a mass-flux closure, as described by McGregor (2003), and includes downdrafts, entrainment and detrainment. CCAM is not only used for climate studies (Nguyen et al. 2011), it is also used in a short-range weather forecast system (Landman et al. 2012).


Methods:

All primary simulations were completed using CSIRO’s global stretched-grid, Conformal Cubic Atmospheric Model (CCAM; McGregor and Dix, 2008) run at 60 km horizontal resolution over the entire globe, while further downscaling to 8 km was conducted for selected partner countries. The CCAM model was chosen for the downscaling because it is a global atmospheric model, so it was possible to bias-adjust the sea-surface temperature in order to improve upon large-scale circulation patterns. In addition, the use of a stretched grid eliminates the problems caused by lateral boundary conditions in limited-area models. The model has been well tested in various model inter-comparisons and in downscaling projects over the Australasian region (Corney et al., 2010).
CCAM 60 km Global simulations:
These simulations were performed for six host global climate models (CSIRO?Mk3.5, ECHAM/MPI?OM, GFDL-CM2.0, GFDL?CM2.1, MIROC3.2 (medres) and UKMO?HadCM3) that were deemed to have acceptable skill in simulating the climate of the Pacific Climate Change Science Program region.
The period 1961-2099 was simulated for the A2 (high) emissions scenario only.

In these simulations, the sea-surface temperature bias?adjustment was calculated by computing the monthly average biases of the global models for the 1971-2000 period, relative to the observed climatology, based upon the method of Reynolds (1988). These monthly biases were then subtracted from the global climate model monthly sea-surface temperature output throughout the simulation. This approach preserves the inter- and intra-annual variability and the climate change signal of the host global climate models.

CCAM 8 km Global simulations:
Due to computational cost, only three of the CCAM 60 km global simulations (those using SSTs from GFDL-CM2.1, UKMO-HadCM3 and ECHAM5) were selected for further downscaling to 8 km. Of the six host models, these three GCM simulations showed a low, middle and high amount of global warming into the future, respectively.
A scale-selective digital filter developed by Thatcher and McGregor (2009) was used to impose the broad-scale (scales greater than approximately 500 km) fields of temperature, moisture and winds above pressure-sigma level .9 (about 1 km above the surface) from the 60 km simulations onto the 8 km simulations.

Limitations:

Climate change projections are inherently uncertain. The future climate will be determined by a combination of factors, including levels of greenhouse gas emissions, unexpected events (e.g. volcanic eruptions), changes in technology and energy use, and sensitivity of the climate system to greenhouse gases, as well as natural variability. Exactly how these factors will unfold is unknown. Climate models have different internal dynamics and parameterisations, and thus respond somewhat differently to the same inputs, producing a range of possible futures. This concern is partly addressed in the current study by selecting CMIP3 GCMs that reproduce current climate reasonably well, then using techniques for bias correction of SSTs that improve their representation in the current climate, but preserve the projected climate change signal and the internal variability. In addition, multi-model means of variables such as temperature and rainfall are assessed to capture the most plausible possible futures. However, the full range of future climate as projected by all GCMs should be considered as well. The best solution is to pick three cases for a given application: the worse case, the best case and the most representative (most evidence) case.

This research has revealed some new insights into the potential future climate in Torres Strait, given our current understanding. In assessing the impact of these projections, careful analysis is required. The results presented from this research are only the first step in developing a greater understanding of future climate in Torres Strait.

            <description type="brief">This dataset consists of rasters representing downscaled climate change scenarios (8 km resolution) for the Torres Strait and Papua New Guinea regions for 1990, 2055, 2090. This includes estimated mean surface relative humidity (%), wind speed, rainfall rate (mm per day) and surface temperature (degrees Celsius) estimated from simulated conditions for 1980?1999, 2046-2065 and 2080?2099 time periods. Also included is the relative change of each attribute with respect to 1990.

For the past decade the Conformal Cubic Atmospheric Model (CCAM) has been the mainstay of CSIRO dynamical downscaling (McGregor 1996, 2005a, 2005b; McGregor and Dix 2001, 2008). CCAM is an atmospheric GCM formulated on the conformal-cubic grid. CCAM includes a fairly comprehensive set of physical parameterizations. The GFDL parameterizations for long-wave and short-wave radiation (Schwarzkopf and Fels 1991; Lacis and Hansen 1974) are employed, with interactive cloud distributions determined by the liquid and ice-water scheme of Rotstayn (1997). The model employs a stability-dependent boundary layer scheme based on Monin-Obukhov similarity theory (McGregor et al. 1993), together with the non-local treatment of Holtslag and Boville (1993). A canopy scheme is included, as described by Kowalczyk et al. (1994), having six layers for soil temperatures, six layers for soil moisture (solving Richard's equation) and three layers for snow. The cumulus convection scheme uses a mass-flux closure, as described by McGregor (2003), and includes downdrafts, entrainment and detrainment. CCAM is not only used for climate studies (Nguyen et al. 2011), it is also used in a short-range weather forecast system (Landman et al. 2012).


Methods:

All primary simulations were completed using CSIRO’s global stretched-grid, Conformal Cubic Atmospheric Model (CCAM; McGregor and Dix, 2008) run at 60 km horizontal resolution over the entire globe, while further downscaling to 8 km was conducted for selected partner countries. The CCAM model was chosen for the downscaling because it is a global atmospheric model, so it was possible to bias-adjust the sea-surface temperature in order to improve upon large-scale circulation patterns. In addition, the use of a stretched grid eliminates the problems caused by lateral boundary conditions in limited-area models. The model has been well tested in various model inter-comparisons and in downscaling projects over the Australasian region (Corney et al., 2010).
CCAM 60 km Global simulations:
These simulations were performed for six host global climate models (CSIRO?Mk3.5, ECHAM/MPI?OM, GFDL-CM2.0, GFDL?CM2.1, MIROC3.2 (medres) and UKMO?HadCM3) that were deemed to have acceptable skill in simulating the climate of the Pacific Climate Change Science Program region.
The period 1961-2099 was simulated for the A2 (high) emissions scenario only.

In these simulations, the sea-surface temperature bias?adjustment was calculated by computing the monthly average biases of the global models for the 1971-2000 period, relative to the observed climatology, based upon the method of Reynolds (1988). These monthly biases were then subtracted from the global climate model monthly sea-surface temperature output throughout the simulation. This approach preserves the inter- and intra-annual variability and the climate change signal of the host global climate models.

CCAM 8 km Global simulations:
Due to computational cost, only three of the CCAM 60 km global simulations (those using SSTs from GFDL-CM2.1, UKMO-HadCM3 and ECHAM5) were selected for further downscaling to 8 km. Of the six host models, these three GCM simulations showed a low, middle and high amount of global warming into the future, respectively.
A scale-selective digital filter developed by Thatcher and McGregor (2009) was used to impose the broad-scale (scales greater than approximately 500 km) fields of temperature, moisture and winds above pressure-sigma level .9 (about 1 km above the surface) from the 60 km simulations onto the 8 km simulations.

Limitations:

Climate change projections are inherently uncertain. The future climate will be determined by a combination of factors, including levels of greenhouse gas emissions, unexpected events (e.g. volcanic eruptions), changes in technology and energy use, and sensitivity of the climate system to greenhouse gases, as well as natural variability. Exactly how these factors will unfold is unknown. Climate models have different internal dynamics and parameterisations, and thus respond somewhat differently to the same inputs, producing a range of possible futures. This concern is partly addressed in the current study by selecting CMIP3 GCMs that reproduce current climate reasonably well, then using techniques for bias correction of SSTs that improve their representation in the current climate, but preserve the projected climate change signal and the internal variability. In addition, multi-model means of variables such as temperature and rainfall are assessed to capture the most plausible possible futures. However, the full range of future climate as projected by all GCMs should be considered as well. The best solution is to pick three cases for a given application: the worse case, the best case and the most representative (most evidence) case.

This research has revealed some new insights into the potential future climate in Torres Strait, given our current understanding. In assessing the impact of these projections, careful analysis is required. The results presented from this research are only the first step in developing a greater understanding of future climate in Torres Strait.

            <description type="brief">&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This dataset contains Lagrangian drifter trajectories from the Connectivity Modelling System (CMS) in the Southeast Indian Ocean. CMS was forced with ocean velocity fields from TROPAC01. These experiments were executed by Christopher Bull of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science (ARCCSS) as part of Christopher’s PhD candidature; this experiment was focused on sources of the Leeuwin Current. TROPAC01 is a high-resolution ocean general circulation model, developed by the European Drakkar cooperation [Barnier et al., 2007] it is based on the NEMO [v3.2 Madec, 2008] code. Specifically, it is a 1/10 horizontal resolution model of the tropical Indo- Pacific region (spanning the area from 73° E–63° W to 49°S – 31° N), nested within a half-degree global ocean/ sea-ice model. More information on the model configuration used for this experiment can be found in [van Sebille et al., 2014]. Using the velocity fields from TROPAC01 we then use the Connectivity Modelling System (CMS) v1.1 [Paris et al., 2013] to integrate the virtual particles in three-dimensional time-evolving flow.&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;Version v1.0 of this dataset includes asci raw model output of CMS trajectories and the forcing file (seedfile) that enables a user to calculate absolute time of a particle’s location.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

            <description type="full">&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Data collected during interviews from 152 clients who entered Logan House between March 2011 and April 2013. The ages of participants ranged from 20 to 64 years.Design and treatment;The study followed a prospective longitudinal design, with the social identity measures taken in the first week of treatment, at 2, 4, 6 weeks, at exit from the TC, and at follow-up planned for 6 months after they left the TC. There was some attrition at each time point, as is typical in TC treatment (e.g., Darke, Campbell, and Popple [2012] reported that 17% of treatment entrants dropped out in the first week, and only 34% successfully completed the treatment program). The number of participants at each assessment point was: 132 at entry, 92 at 2 weeks, 71 at 4 weeks, 54 at 6 weeks, 27 at exit from the TC, and 60 at follow-up. One reason for the low number at exit is that a substantial proportion of departures from the TC were unplanned and many occurred for rule violations (such as substance use while residing at the TC). This made it challenging for the researchers to obtain exit data in a majority of cases. The average length of stay at the TC was 99 days (SD = 76 days). Multiple attempts were made to contact every participant at the follow-up (an average of 7 months after leaving the TC) to ensure that the sub-sample was as representative as possible. A series of t-tests were conducted on demographic, substance use, and social identity variables at admission to the TC to investigate possible group differences between the subsample that were followed up (N = 60) and those who were lost to follow-up (N = 72). The t-tests showed no significance differences on substance-use history, well-being, or identity variables. The only significant difference was on years of education completed, which was higher in those included in the follow-up (M = 11.18, SD = 2.017) than in those lost to follow-up (M = 10.41, SD = 1.956). However, as both subsamples had an average of lower than secondary school education, and education was not included in any of the main analyses, this difference was not considered to have any influence on the findings and the follow-up subsample may be considered as representative of the original full sample.Procedure;Potential participants were identified by the manager of the TC when they were settled and ready to be interviewed, typically during their first week. They were then approached by a member of the research team and interviewed using the Addiction Severity Index, and then given a packet of questionnaires to complete and return. The researcher remained nearby to offer help if required. Participants were offered chocolates and cans of soft drink for completing each assessment point. The follow ups were conducted using contact details that the participants had given on their consent form. Follow-up surveys were conducted over the telephone (42%), in person (37%), and by mail (22%). Participants were reimbursed $30 for their completed follow ups. All measures and procedures were approved by the University Of Queensland Ethics Review Committee (approval #2011000953).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

            <description type="lineage">The data is based on a literature survey of studies that proposed, implemented or tested on-ground options for facilitating persistence or adaptation of species or ecosystems under climate change (hereafter ‘options’). We searched Web of Science (to 31 December 2016) under the topics of ecology, environmental sciences, environmental studies, forestry and biodiversity conservation for publications that included at least one term from each of the following three groups: (1) ecolog*, ecosystem, biodiversity, forest, woodland, rangeland, grassland, shrubland, heathland, rainforest, wetland, mangrove, saltmarsh, shore, tidal, dune, river, stream, freshwater, riparian, desert, dryland, species, nature; (2) adapt*, interven*, restor*, engineer*, revegetation, conserv* and (3) climate change, warming, CO2, aridif*, changing climate. Additional studies known to authors were also included, noting we do not expect to have fully captured specialized literature on some topics (e.g. assisted colonization). Our search resulted in 16,753 publications, which reduced on screening of titles and abstracts to 640, then on full text to 473 papers reviewed and scored for this analysis (Appendix S1). Criteria for inclusion included (1) an emphasis on biodiversity or nature conservation (rather than livelihoods); (2) an interest in active on–ground management response rather than solely climate change impacts, policy or social aspects; but including selection of areas for conservation protection or action; (3) a terrestrial focus (including land-based aquatic but not marine). We systematically scored each of the 473 papers for publication date, ecosystems or organisms studied, geographic regions of study and types of inference used (field observations or experiments, reports of implementation, ecological reasoning, conceptual frameworks, modelling and reviews). ‘Ecological reasoning’ included commentaries or reasoning based on impact assessments, stakeholder workshops and surveys, ecological theory and/or earlier literature. Modelling studies involved simulation of outcomes of applying adaptation interventions, and reviews focused on assessment of evidence from past literature for outcomes of interventions. An individual study could be scored more than once in any classification. Based on this literature we created a typology of intervention options. We derived our typology using an iterative approach. We began by randomly selecting publications from our literature search, extracting information on the interventions they discussed or tested, and trialing organization of the information using insights drawn from overview and synthesis literature. This dual bottom-up and top-down approach allowed us to establish a preliminary, tractable set of ‘intervention option types’ (hereafter option types), and to organize these into preliminary higher level groupings (see results). Whilst recognizing there would be many potential ways to classify the information, we aimed for a simple classification that captured some key concepts relevant to underpinning ecological mechanisms and to practical concerns. We continued to build the set of preliminary option types until adjustments and new categories became infrequent, leading to a preliminary typology after 70 publications. Beginning with this preliminary typology, a single operator then systematically scored intervention options proposed, tested or described in each of the 473 papers, including re-scoring of the initial 70 publications. Refinements were made to the typology where new ideas were encountered, with rescoring of earlier papers if refinements could have affected their scores (e.g. splitting or reconceptualisation of a preliminary category). In total, this process led to 1304 instances of option types scored from the 473 papers.</description>

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;LOVECLIM is an acronym made from the names of the five different models that have been coupled to built the Earth system model: LOch–Vecode-Ecbilt-CLio-agIsm Model (LOVECLIM). &amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;a&amp;quot;&amp;gt;LOVECLIM 1.2 &amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;a&amp;quot;&amp;gt;includes representations of the atmosphere, the ocean and sea ice, the land surface &amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;a&amp;quot;&amp;gt;(including vegetation), the ice sheets, the icebergs and the carbon cycle. The atmospheric &amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;a&amp;quot;&amp;gt;component is ECBilt2, a T21, 3-level quasi-geostrophic model. The oceanic component is &amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;a&amp;quot;&amp;gt;CLIO3, which is made up of an ocean general circulation model coupled to a &amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;a&amp;quot;&amp;gt;comprehensive thermodynamic-dynamic sea-ice model. Its horizontal resolution is 3° by&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;a&amp;quot;&amp;gt;3°, and there are 20 levels in the ocean. ECBilt-CLIO is coupled to VECODE, a vegetation &amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;a&amp;quot;&amp;gt;model that simulates the dynamics of two main terrestrial plant functional types, trees and &amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;a&amp;quot;&amp;gt;grasses, as well as desert. VECODE also simulates the evolution of the carbon cycle over&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;a&amp;quot;&amp;gt;land while the oceanic carbon cycle is represented in LOCH, a comprehensive model that &amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;a&amp;quot;&amp;gt;takes into account both the solubility and biological pumps.&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

            <description type="lineage">The first extensive mapping of the Fenton Fault was carried out by Wade in 1934. Later investigators, including Dr. F.
Reeves (1951) have given it a lot of attention during their investigations in the Fitzroy and/or southern Canning Basins. During the past few years, it has been mapped in comparative detail from surface geology and crossed by geophysical traverses (airborne magnetometer, gravity and seismic), by geological and geophysical parties of the
Bureau of Mineral Resources and of the West Australian Petroleum Pty.Ltd. The investigations have not, in general, been carried more than a few miles to the south-west of the known part of the Fenton Fault, because of masking of the geology and difficulty of access caused by the sand dunes of the north-west desert.</description>

            <description type="brief">The Fenton Fault, one of the major tectonic lines in the Canning and Fitzroy Basins, has always presented a major problem to geologists seeking to determine its true nature and significance. The investigation described in this report was intended to contribute towards a solution of the problem. This investigation included a seismic reflection traverse across the Fault in the area of Barnes Flow, near where previous gravity and airborne magnetic traverses had crossed it, together with refraction traverses on each side of
and across the fault.

The results of previous surveys are discussed, and show that the gravity meter is a most useful tool for the further investigation of the Fenton Fault. However, unless new and effective treatment of results can be devised, it is of doubtful value in investigating folding within the Fitzroy Basin, though this does not necessarily
detract from its value for regional surveys. The airborne magnetometer on the other hand, is not a reasonable tool for investigating the Fault.

It is concluded that the Fenton Fault at Barnes Flow is a normal fault, downthrown to the north-east, with a throw probably exceeding 10,000 feet. The thickness of the sedimentary section on the north side of the Fault near Barnes Flow probably exceeds 16,000 feet. On the south side a velocity of over 20,000 ft/sec. was
recorded from a depth of 5,500 feet. This probably indicates the depth to basement at this point. On the south side of the Fault at Jurgurra Creek the sedimentary section appears to be about 7,000 feet thick.

The conclusion that baaement is relatively shallow to the south of the fault could be tested by drilling. The rig used should be capable of drilling to at least 6,000 feet to ensure that the 20,000 ft/sec. refractor may be penetrated and identified.</description>

            <description type="lineage">37 fights were documented between naturally occurring floaters and territory owners. The majority of these contests were observed in the field, however 3 fights were assessed using footage from a Sony Digital Video Camera. 

Major claw length (manus+pollex) and carapace width of each male were measured to the nearest 0.1mm using dial callipers. Fight duration was either timed in the field using a handheld stopwatch and recorded to the nearest 0.01s, or using a Sony Digital Video Camera after the event.</description>
            <description type="lineage">37 fights were documented. A standard set of data was collected for each fight. For each fight the date, time, the type of floater, and winner were recorded. Additionally, all crabs were measured, and fighting phases as well as fight duration were recorded.  The winner is the male that owns the territory at the end of a fight. The loser is the crab which walks away at the end of the fight. A fight was considered over when: a) the loser walked &amp;gt;30cm away, b) travelled past two other males territories, c) entered another burrow, or d) started another fight.

Parameters: Datatype (1=field, 2=video), encounter ID, date, ltidet (time of diurnal low tide), hightideht (high tide height of the tide which follows the diurnal low tide), rtimet (time of the fight), tsltide (number of minutes since low tide), ctype (intruder type, NF=Natural Floater), winner, cara (intruder carapace width - mm), chel (inturder cheliped / claw length - mm), ocara (owner carapace width - mm), ochel (owner cheliped / claw length -mm), actions observed (P=push, B=burrow, G=grapple, F=flick, D=dig, Pi=pinch, TB=true burrow fighting), dura (duration of fight - seconds), digdura (dig duration - seconds), sizediff (size difference between owner and intruder claws - mm).</description>

            <description type="full">Resource owners generally win contests against intruders, a phenomenon referred to as the 'Owner Advantage' (OA). Uca mjoebergi is a typical fiddler crab that is highly sociable, territorial and lives in mixed sex colonies on intertidal mudflats. Burrows are used in territory defence, for mating, and as refuge from predators and environmental stresses. Fights are common between owners and floating males who battle for ownership of the territory and burrow. 

Experiments were conducted from 28th Sept - 30 Dec 2006 at the lower reaches of Ludmilla Creek within East Point Reserve, 5km North of Darwin, NT. This experiment found that when attacked by naturally occurring floaters, owners were most likely to win fights. Owners won 91.9% of fights against naturally occurring floaters. There is therefore a strong ownership advantage in this species.</description>

            <description type="lineage">The macrofauna of adjacent seagrass and bare sand habitats were sampled in Princess Royal Harbour and King George Sound, Albany on six nights in January 1988.  Trawling was carried out as close as possible to high tide on 15, 18, 20, 22, 24 and 25 January 1988 (full moon was 19 January).  A roller beam trawl, 1 m wide, 0.5 m deep and with panels of mesh size 3 mm and a cod end of mesh size 1 mm was used.  The net was towed three times at each site at approximately 0.04 ms-1 between two markers set 50 m apart.  Thus the fauna from an area of 50 m2 was sampled with each trawl and a total of 18 trawls carried out per habitat.  The total time taken to complete the 12 trawls each night was 45-60 mins.

Posidonia australis meadows at 1 m depth in Princess Royal Harbour and P. sinuosa meadows at 5 m depth in King George Sound were sampled (see thumbnail).  It was not possible to sample the same species of seagrass in the two locations as the heavy epiphytic algae on P. sinuosa in Princess Royal Harbour at 5 m depth filled the trawl net on commencement of towing.  Therefore, trawls were made in a shallow eutrophic  P. australis habitat in Princess Royal Harbour (PRHS), in an adjacent bare sand habitat in Princess Royal Harbour (PRHB) and at a deeper oligotrophic P. sinuosa habitat in King George Sound (KGSS) and in an adjacent bare sand habitat in King George Sound (KGSB).  The seagrass and bare sand habitats were approximately 10 m from each other at both locations and at similar depths to their adjacent seagrass habitats.  From historic aerial photographs and personal observations the bare sand sites had not supported seagrass in the recent past.

After each trawl, samples were placed in bags, sorted and preserved in 70% ethanol.  Fish, macrocrustaceans and molluscs were identified (usually) to species and counted.</description>

            <description type="full">A short-term sampling programme in Princess Royal Harbour aimed to compare the mobile macrofauna of a shallow eutrophic seagrass habitat (Posidonia australis) with an adjacent sand habitat.  In addition, the mobile macrofauna of an apparently oligotrophic seagrass habitat (Posidonia sinuosa) in King George Sound with an adjacent sand habitat.  Species diversity and abundance of fish, macro-crustaceans and molluscs among habitats were also investigated.  This sampling was carried out on series of nights between 15th and 25th January 1988.</description>

            <description type="brief">## **Abstract** 

The dataset was derived by the Bioregional Assessment Programme from multiple source datasets. The source datasets are identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement.



Development of the MBC PAE considered predicted water level impacts reported for the Underground Water Impact Report (UWIR) for the Surat Cumulative Management Area (QWC 2012). The predicted water level impacts have been calculated using a regional groundwater flow model designed to predict the impacts of groundwater extraction by the petroleum and gas extraction industries within the Qld portion of the Surat and Bowen Basins. 



The Long-term Affected Area 95th percentile maximum drawdown grids for the Walloon Coal Measure, Hutton Sandstone, Precipice Sandstone and Clematis Sandstone were assessed to determine the lateral extent of the 1m drawdown boundary. The 1m drawdown boundaries extend in some areas, beyond the MBC subregion boundary to the north. North of Roma, the modelled impact to water levels in both the Precipice and Clematis Sandstone is predominantly as a result of CSG extraction from Bandana Formation of the Bowen Basin in the Fairview and Spring Gully gas fields, which are located outside to MBC subregion. Therefore the 1m drawdown extents for Precipice and Clematis Sandstones north of Roma were not considered in the development of the PAE. 



In contrast, the northern extent of the 1m drawdown boundary in the Hutton Sandstone, which extends beyond the subregion boundary toward the Hutton Sandstone recharge areas, has been considered. In this case the drawdown is a result of extraction within the subregion. 



As a conservative approach, a 50km buffer was applied to each drawdown grid and the most laterally extensive boundaries for each formation were incorporated into the PAE boundary. The 50km buffer extends to the north beyond the subregion boundary and either beyond or close to outer boundary of the Hutton Sandstone. In this area the outer edge of the Hutton sandstone has been used for the PAE as it is unlikely that the deeper formation will be impacted by extraction from within the MBC subregion. Elsewhere the where the 50km buffer extends beyond the subregion boundary the buffer has been clipped to match the boundary of the subregion where it coincides with the edge of the Surat geological basin. An exception is the easternmost extent of the PAE. In this case the PAE is a combination of the 50km buffer and the outer boundary of the Marburg Sandstone which is a lateral equivalent of the Hutton Sandstone. 



The PAE allows full assessment of impacts to the Hutton Sandstone and shallower aquifers as well as those areas of the Clematis and Precipice sandstones from extraction of groundwater within the MBC subregion. Further, in the east the PAE encompasses current operating coal mines.

Toolboxes\System Toolboxes\Analysis Tools.tbx\Proximity\Buffer



Create the PAE:

In the North West, from the intersection of the MBC subregion and Hutton intake beds, follow the Hutton Intake beds boundary until the Eastern MBC subregion boundary, where the drawdown buffer extends past the subregion boundary. From there, use the Marburg Surface Geology boundary as the extent until it intersects back with the drawdown buffer polygon. Follow the drawdown buffer polygon south until it intersects with the MBC boundary in the South West, then follow the MBC subregion boundary again East along the Southern boundary until it intersects again with the drawdown buffer polygon boundary. Follow the drawdown buffer polygon boundary from the South to the Western edge and up to the North Western starting point to finish off the MBC groundwater PAE.

            <description type="full">&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
    The PaleoAge and PaleoDepth dataset provides access to grid data relating to the age and bathymetry of the world&amp;amp;#39;s ocean crust for the last 140 million years. The PaleoAge and PaleoDepth dataset focuses on two specific problems - the reconstruction of vanished oceans and the tracking of oceanic depth through time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Reconstructing vanished oceans&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
    The dataset establishes the locations and geometry of mid ocean ridges through time on the basis of marine magnetic anomaly identifications, geological information such as paleomagnetic data from terranes and microcontinents, especially in the Tethys Ocean, mid-oceanic ridge subduction events and the rules of plate tectonics. Based on a global set of tectonic plate rotations, a set of refined seafloor isochrons is constructed, following the interpolation technique outlined by M&amp;amp;uuml;ller et al. (1997; 2008).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Oceanic depth through time &amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
    The EarthByte Group has created a set of paleo-bathymetry maps by adding major oceanic plateaus and sediment thickness to existing reconstructed basement depth maps. These maps enable the computation of oceanic crustal area and mean depth through time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
    The PaleoAge and PaleoDepth dataset and supporting documentation is available via the &amp;lt;a href="http://www.earthbyte.org/"&amp;gt;EarthByte&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; website. The dataset includes documents (including related papers, supplementary materials and tables), images, grid data, associated user documentation, videos, and links to related datasets.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

            <description type="brief">A shallow firn core drilling program was conducted in eastern Wilkes Land in 1985 by an ANARE glaciological team.  In conjunction with surveys carried out on ice sheet topography and snow surface characteristics, 250 m of firn cores were retrieved from 15 shallow boreholes to investigate the firn-pack structure and firn stratigraphy.  Firn layer density, grain size and visible stratigraphy were measured on all cores.  The measured firn core data are presented.

A major objective of the International Antarctic Glaciological Project (IAGP) during the 1980's has been to measure and define the mass balance distribution over the Wilkes Land region of the East Antarctic ice sheet.  Australia has participated by conducting Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions (ANARE) glaciological traverses in Wilkes Land between 1971 and 1986.  These traverses operated from Casey station and achieved the greatest areal coverage of Wilkes Land from 1978-86 by establishing an eastern, southern and western route.
The eastern and western routes approximately traverse the 2000m contour between 95 degrees East and 131 degrees East, whilst the southern route extends from the coast to 74 degrees South inland approximately along the 112 degrees East longitude.

During 1985, in conjunction with the resurvey of the eastern route, shallow firn core drilling and stratigraphic investigations were carried out at 50 km intervals between 112 degrees East and 132 degrees East.  This route is located wholly within the katabatic slope region of East Antarctica.  The dominating feature of the region is the persistent katabatic wind which drains cold air down from the ice sheet's interior to the coast.  This katabatic wind is fundamental in controlling the firnification processes operating at the snow surface and within the snow/firn-pack.

Preliminary snow stratigraphic investigations were carried out in 2-3 m deep pits along the same route route in 1982, and were reported by Jones (1983). These observations showed that the region was dominated by annual net accumulation which was marked by thin crusts in the snow-pack.  These ice crusts were attributed to surface sintering of saltating snow grains following kinetic energy loss under constantly strong katabatic wind flow.  Jones (1983) also reported the formation of thin radiation glazes during the summer season.  From his observations it was recognised that a detailed investigation of the physical characteristics and stratigraphy of the firn-pack could produce extended records of annual net accumulation and define the firn-pack structure for later correlation with remotely sensed data, in particular satellite passive microwave (ESMR) data.

This report lists the firn core data obtained during the 1985 drilling and stratigraphic investigations and describes the drilling operations.  Detailed density, grain size and visible stratigraphic profiles were measured in the field on a total of 250 m of firn cores drilled from 15 boreholes ranging from 10-35 m in depth.  Temporal accumulation records have been interpreted from both the firn core data listed in this report and additional oxygen-isotope measurements made on the cores in Australia.  A major supporting data bank on snow surface characteristics, accumulation rates and topography obtained in 1985 along the eastern route reported in Goodwin (1988).

METHODS
A total 250m of firn cores were drilled and retrieved using the PICO (Polar Ice Coring Office) lightweight hand-operated coring auger described by Koci and Kuivinen (1984).

Shallow boreholes were drilled at 5 m, 10 m and 30-35 m depths along the traverse route.  The drilling sites were located at each of the 15 Doppler satellite positioning survey stations spaced at 50 km intervals along the route.  The 10 m boreholes were drilled to obtain firn core representing accumulation over the previous decade (1975-85).  These holes were extended to 30-35 m depth at 150 km intervals along the route (GD03, GD06, GD09, GD12 and GD15) to represent accumulation over the past five decades (1935-85).  These depths were estimated from accumulation rates measured on marker canes at the surface between 1982 and 1985, prior to the drilling operations.  The 5m depth holes were adjacent (within 1 m) to the deeper 30-35 m depth poles to provide duplicate cores for additional measurements.

The 10 m holes were drilled without lifting tackle and the total drilling time including setting up and logging the core totalled 1.5 hours.  For holes drilled deeper than 10 m a 'tripod' system was used to lift the drill string. The 'tripod' consisted of a bipod constructed from scaffold pipe erected on the raised (1.5 m high) blade of a Caterpillar D5 tractor.  The bipod arrangement was supported by rope and chain to the rear of the cabin.  The tripod was 6 m above the drilling platform.  This enabled 5 m lengths of the drill string to be assembled or disassembled in the hole, each time the string was raised or lowered.  The lifting tackle comprised 15 mm thick manila rope, one double sheaf block and one single sheaf block.  To break the core before raising the drill string, two loops of rope were attached around the T handle, to take the full weight of the drill and to apply a constant force, whilst two people lifted the T handle with a jerking motion.  This method of lifting and breaking proved to be simple and effective.  The total drilling time for 0-25 m, 0-30 m and 0-35 m depths was 5.5 hours, 8.5 hours and 13 hours respectively.  All cores were logged on site.

Excellent core retrieval and quality was achieved using 45 degree angled, drill head cutters and a 2 m long core barrel.  Generally, each retrieved core section was between 0.85 and 1.1 m long.

FIRN CORE MEASUREMENTS AND DATA
Following the completion of the drilling and core retrieval phase at each site, the cores were measured and sampled in a field laboratory.  The cores, except GD06 and GD09 which were archived for detailed analysis in Australia, were measured for visible stratigraphy, grain size and density.

Core sections were measured and logged for visible stratigraphy and grain size on a transmission light box in the outer cold room of the laboratory.  The temperature of the work area was maintained by the outside ambient air temperature, which was generally -15 to -35 degrees C.  The position of every optically different firn layer was measured by tape and the corresponding grain size of each layer was measured using a hand held 7 x optical magnifier with a 0.1 mm resolving graticule.  Thus, the grain size measurements were made on bulk longitudinal sections.  Ice crusts, including transparent radiation crusts/glazes and opaque wind/crusts/glazes were described and their thickness measured.

Density measurements were made on every layer identified in the visible stratigraphy.  Each firn layer was cut from the remaining core section and its diameter and length measured using vernier calipers and weighed on a 2.5 kg beam balance.  The densities were then calculated from the core dimensions and core mass.

Firn core data comprising layer density, grain size and ice crust thickness are listed for the borehole sizes (except GD06 and GD09) in the file held at the url below.  The site characteristics are also held in a spreadsheet at the url given below.  These include geographic position, surface elevation, accumulation rate and mean annual surface temperature.  Detailed firn temperature-depth profiles for each borehole are reported in Goodwin (1988).

Both the firn layer density and grain size profiles display cyclicity, which results from the development of depth hoar and within the annual firn layer. The depth hoar corresponds to the lower density values in the profile and develops beneath the strong ice crusts identified by the visible stratigraphy, as a result of upward water vapour transport under strong temperature gradients.  The ice crusts represent the successive seasonal surface layers which were observed throughout the ANARE traverses in the region.  The thickest crusts in the range 0.7-4.0 mm represent the autumn or early winter wind crust which forms under persistent strong winds (30-50 knots) during a major hiatus in snow supply and consequently marks the end of the balance year.  It is spatially continuous and well developed which results in its preservation in the firn-pack.  The thinner crusts in the range 0.3-0.5 mm represent the late spring and summer radiation crusts.  Both types of crusts are impermeable.

2007/2008 Season update
A successful field season was undertaken at Macquarie Island during the 07/08 summer. This included maintenance of the annual surveys of pup production (DNA sampling for species identification), pup tagging and resighting of individual seals for assessment of reproductive performance and survival for long-term demographic analyses. Two publications in the journal Molecular Ecology on reproductive success of hybrids and mating strategies to limit hybridisation were produced, and the preparation of a major manuscript on the colonisation, status and trends in abundance of the three fur seal species at Macquarie Island has been completed and will be submitted shortly. 

Progress has been made of three main fronts:
1. Completed field season at Macquarie Island and maintenance of the annual surveys of pup production (DNA sampling for species identification), pup tagging and resighting of individual seals for assessment of reproductive performance and survival for long-term demographic analyses.
2. Two publications in the journal Molecular Ecology on reproductive success of hybrids and mating strategies to limit hybridisation,
3. The preparation of a major manuscript on the colonisation, status and trends in abundance of the three fur seal species at Macquarie Island.
We plan to make significant developments in demographic database management and analyses over the 08/09.

Taken from the 2008-2009 Progress Report:
Project objectives:
Background 1986-2008
The 'conservation and management of fur seals in the Antarctic marine ecosystem' research program (hereafter referred to as "the fur seal program") aims to provide key performance measures for recovering fur seal populations, and key Antarctic State of the Environment indicators, to monitor how biological and physical oceanographic change in Southern Ocean ecosystems, effects the reproductive performance of high trophic-level predators such as fur seals. Fur seals were the most heavily exploited of all of the Antarctic marine biota, and populations on both of Australia's subantarctic islands (Macquarie and the Heard and MacDonald Islands, HIMI), have yet to recover to pre-sealing numbers.

Over the last twenty years (1986-2007), research undertaken on this and former programs (managed by Dr Peter Shaughnessy) have aimed to provide information on:
- the population status and ecology of recovering fur seal populations on Macquarie and Heard Islands,
- species identification and composition,
- the extent, trends, processes and implications of hybridisation among fur seals at Macquarie Island,
- the impact of commercial sealing on the genetic variation and population structure of southern ocean fur seal populations,
- the foraging ecology and lactation strategies of fur seals at Heard and Macquarie Islands,
- the trophic linkages between fur seals and commercial fisheries at Macquarie and Heard Islands, and
- how physical and biological oceanographic changes affect the reproductive performance of fur seals.

The fur seal program has successfully achieved these aims, and in doing so made significant contributions to implementing the many milestones of Australia's Antarctic Science Strategy (both past and present). In addition, the program has provided important advice on the conservation and management of Southern Ocean fur seal populations and marine systems, including:
- providing information to Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA) to assist ecological sustainable development (ESD) of the Patagonian toothfish fisheries around Macquarie and Heard Islands.
- proving information to Environment Australia (now DEWR) on the distribution of fur seal foraging effort to assist planning and development of the Macquarie Island Marine Park.
- providing specific data on the status of the subantarctic fur seal at Macquarie Island to DEWR, and assisting as a member of the subantarctic fur seal Recovery Team.
- providing regular updates on the status of fur seal populations at Macquarie and Heard Islands to the SCAR Expert Group on Seals.
- reporting to the Antarctic State of the Environment (Indicator 32).

The fur seal program is now one of the longest standing ongoing biological studies supported by the Australian Antarctic Division, providing an important time-series of population recovery following human exploitation, and most recently (after identification of sensitive demographic responses to small changes in sea surface temperatures), important ecological performance indicators and reference points that provide some of the best examples of how climate change may impact high trophic-level predator populations in the Southern Ocean.

The next five years (2008-2012)
Over the next five years, the fur seal program aims to build on the above successes and continue core aspects population monitoring and demography. There will be a continued focus on undertaking research with clear applied management applications and a strong strategic focus targeting specific priorities of Australia's Antarctic Science Program Science Strategy. Applied applications include ESD of fisheries, MPA management and planning, acting on research and management priorities set out in the Department of the Environment and Heritage "The Action Plan for Australian Seals", the Recovery Plans for the Subantarctic fur seal and Antarctic State of the Environment reporting (SEO Indicator No. 32). All of these are in accord with and will help implement Australia's Oceans Policy.

The last five years of the fur seal program have seen considerable advancement in our understanding of the extent, trends and processes that facilitate and limit hybridisation among the three fur seal species at Macquarie Island. We have also identified highly significant relationships between fur seal reproductive success (fecundity and pup growth rates) and small changes to local sea surface temperature (STT) north of Macquarie Island associated with the subantarctic front. We also have a considerable data base on the survival and reproductive success of known-aged animals extending back to the early 1990s, and because of significant progress in developing molecular methods for identification of species and hybrids over the last five years, we now also have detailed genotype data for a large proportion of these seals (approx. 1,300).

With these data sets and knowledge, the focus of the fur seal program over the next five years will be to integrate molecular, demographic and oceanographic data to provide further insights into the how climatic and oceanographic changes in the Southern Ocean affect fur seal population on both annual and lifetime scales. The specific aims of the fur seal program will be to:

1. Maintain the population monitoring programs at Macquarie and Heard Islands
2. Maintain the long-term demographic program at Macquarie Island and analysis of data to determine age-specific survival and fecundity rates for each species and determine the reproductive costs of hybridisation.
3. Calculate annual changes in foraging ecology, survival, recruitment, reproductive rates and pup growth, and relate these to annual changes in regional oceanography.

The scientific relevance of these objectives are detailed below.

Progress against objectives:
Progress has been made of three main fronts:
1. Field season at Macquarie Island during the 2008/09 summer has been completed. This included maintenance of the annual surveys of pup production (DNA sampling for species identification), pup tagging and resighting of individual seals for assessment of reproductive performance and survival for long-term demographic analyses.
2. A publication titled: "Fur seals at Macquarie Island: post-sealing colonisation, trends in abundance and hybridisation of three fur seals species" has been accepted for publication in Polar Biology.
3. Some database maintenance has been undertaken on the demographic database.

Taken from the 2010-2011 Progress Report:
Public summary of the season progress:
A successful field season was undertaken at Macquarie Island during the 10/11 season. This included maintenance of the annual surveys of pup production (DNA sampling for species identification), pup tagging and resighting of individual seals for assessment of reproductive performance and survival for long-term demographic analyses. A total of 255 pups were recorded this season, about an 8% increases since the 2009/10 season and more than any previous year since recolonisation. A new PhD program has commenced this year the focus will be analyses of the 25 year demographic dataset, and the impacts of climate change on population recovery.</description>

            <description type="brief">APIS data were collected between 1994 and 1999. This dataset also includes some historical data collected between 1985 and 1987. Both aerial and ship-board surveys were conducted. Studies on the behaviour of Pack-ice or Crabeater Seal (Lobodon carcinophagus) in the Southern Ocean and in the Australian Sector of Antarctica were also conducted as part of this study. Satellite tracking was used to determine their movement, durations on land and at sea, dive depths and dive duration etc. The four species of Antarctic pack ice seals (crabeater, leopard, Weddell, and Ross seals) are thought to comprise up to 50% or more of the world's total biomass of seals. As long-lived, top level predators in Southern Ocean ecosystems, pack ice seals are scientifically interesting because they can assist in monitoring shifts in ecosystem structure and function, especially changes that occur in sensitive polar areas in response to global climate changes. 
     
The APIS Program focuses on the ecological importance of pack ice seals and their interactions with physical and biotic features of their environment. This program is a collaborative, multi-disciplinary research initiative whose planning and implementation has involved scientists from more than a dozen countries. It is being developed and coordinated by the Group of Specialists on Seals of the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR), and represents an important contribution to SCAR's Antarctic Global Change Program. Australian researchers have undertaken an ambitious science program studying the distribution and abundance of pack ice seals in support of the APIS Program. An excellent overview of this work is provided at the Australian Antarctic Division's web site. The following paragraphs provide a brief progress report of some of that work through 1998. ======================================
     
Four years of developmental work have now been completed in preparation for the Australian contribution to the circumpolar survey that will take place in December 1998. Until recently the main effort has been directed towards designing and building a system for automatic data logging of line transect data by double observers. Two systems identical in concept have been designed for aerial survey and shipboard survey. The systems consist of a number of sighting guns and keypads linked to a central computer. The sightings guns are used to measure the exact time and angle of declination from the horizon of seals passing abeam of the survey platform. Also logged regularly (10 second intervals) are GPS position and altitude (aerial survey only). The aerial survey system also has an audio backup. The aerial survey system has been trialled over three seasons and the shipboard system over one season. Preliminary analysis of aerial data indicates that the essential assumption of the line transect method is badly violated, reinforcing the need for double observers. Assumption violation is likely to be less in shipboard survey, but assessment of the assumption of perfect sightability on the line is still important. User manuals have been written for both the aerial and shipboard systems. An aerial survey system is being constructed for use by BAS in the coming season. A backup manual system for aerial and shipboard survey has also been developed in the event of the automatic system failing. The aerial backup system uses the perspex sighting frame developed by the US. A database has been designed for storage and analysis of aerial and shipboard data. Importing of data is fast and easy, allowing post-survey analysis and review immediately after each day's survey effort. Aides for training observers have been developed. A video on species identification has been produced. A Powerpoint slide show has been designed to simulate aerial survey conditions and use of the automatic data logging system. Currently effort has been directed toward developing an optimal survey design. While a general survey plan is necessary, it must be flexible to deal with unpredictable ice and weather conditions. It is planned to use both the ship and two Sikorsky 76 helicopters as survey platforms. The ship will be used to survey into and out from stations, and inwards from the ice edge for approximately 60 miles. The helicopters will be used to survey southwards from the ship for distances up to 140 miles in favourable weather. Helicopters will fly in tandem, with transects 10 miles apart. Studies of crabeater seal haul-out behaviour have been conducted over the past four seasons. Twenty SLTDRs have been deployed in the breeding season (September-October). The length of deployments varies from a few days to 3 months. No transmissions have been received after mid-January, probably due to loss of instruments during the moult. Most instruments have transmitted data through the survey period of November-December. Haul-out behaviour is consistent between animals and years. However, five more instruments will be deployed in the survey season to ensure there is haul-out data concurrent with the survey effort. Some observations of penguins and whales were also made.

Law Dome is a small (200 km in diameter) ice sheet located at the edge of the Indian Ocean sector of East Antarctica. The core site, near the summit of Law Dome (66 degrees 46'S, 112 degrees 48'E), is characterised by a high rate of accumulation (late Holocene average, 0.68 m ice equivalent per year) that results in an ice core with a highly tapered time scale in which the Holocene represents some 93% of the ice thickness of 1200 m. However, the full Law Dome isotopic record generally matches the long records from Vostok and Byrd to at least 80 ka, indicating that the record is continuous and undisturbed over this period. The Law Dome record is suited to gas-synchronisation studies because the high accumulation rate and consequent rapid burial give a small age difference (Delta age) between trapped air and the older enclosing ice.

Derivation of an age scale for the Law Dome core, is based upon a Dansgaard- Johnsen flow model (S1) matched to the observed layer thinning (S2). Continuously sampled seasonal cycles down to ~1/3 ice-thickness (~1ky) and spot measurements of seasonal layers to ~85% ice-thickness (~4 ky) constrain the ice-flow model through this period in which mean accumulation is assumed to be free of large trends. Chronological control in the lower portion of the ice-sheet prior to 4 ky is through ties to other records. For the period of discussion, namely 10 ky to 17 ky, ties at 9.6 ky, 11.0 ky, 11.6 ky, 12.5 ky, 12.8 ky, 14.3 ky and 16.3 ky, are obtained by matching air composition changes with those of GRIP. The 9.6 ky tie is obtained by matching to d18O of air in GRIP (S3) and GISP2 (S4) data, and the remainder synchronise with the Byrd and GRIP CH4 records (S5). Dust concentration data also provide additional constraints on the 16.3 ky tie. Beyond 16.3 ky control is by a tie at 32 ky (based on both dust and d18Oice matched to the Byrd ice core (S6) on the GRIP timescale (S5)). The mean temporal resolution of the LD isotope data is ~24y through this period.

The air-composition age-ties require Delta age computations for sequencing events within the LD record and for synchronisation of the chronology with GRIP. The high accumulation at DSS results in a particularly small Delta age value. The modern difference between ice-age and gas-age is 60 plus or minus 2 years for methane (S7). Note that at such low Delta age values, the diffusive mixing time from the free atmosphere down to seal-off depth becomes significant and must be accounted for; in the case of CH4 this is ~8 years (S7).

The absolute chronology derived for the LD record has contributions from both the LD and GRIP Delta age errors, but the relative timing between the LD CH4 and water isotope (d18Oice) signals is only uncertain to within the small errors associated with LD Delta age.

While the present-day trapping age at LD is small, lower temperatures and accumulation rates during the deglaciation lead to longer trapping times. To estimate Delta age under past conditions, we use a model (S8) to compute trapping age from accumulation and temperature (this model agrees with precise experimentally determined present day values). Since we have no direct indicators for palaeoaccumulation and palaeotemperature, we adopt two scenarios that use alternative estimation methods.

Estimation of palaeotemperature from the isotope data in both scenarios is by application of a calibration slope, "Beta ppt/degrees C". For the young chronology, which has minimum Delta age, the commonly applied spatial slope of Beta=0.67 ppt/degrees C is used, giving relatively warm temperatures. The default chronology uses a long-term temporal calibration (S9) for Law Dome, Beta=0.44 ppt/degrees C. This estimate, which is seasonally derived, gives greater temperature sensitivity for isotopic changes than the spatial slope. The use of this lower value for Beta is supported by direct comparisons between annual averages in d18O and temperature at the site and elsewhere on Law Dome. Over several years to a few decades, these yield coefficients of typically ~0.33 ppt/degrees C. We adopt the value 0.44 ppt/degrees C as a conservative choice, based on a longer-term calibration and because the incorporation of seasonal sea-ice variations may better capture glacial-to- Holocene environmental shifts.

Estimation of palaeoaccumulation for the young chronology is via the commonly applied method (see, e.g. S5) that scales modern accumulation-rate using the derivative of saturation vapour-pressure versus temperature relationship (also using Beta=0.67 ppt/degrees C). This method explicitly assumes no non-thermodynamic changes to moisture transport during climate variations (such as, e.g., atmospheric circulation changes) that may be important at this near-coastal location. Our alternative palaeoaccumulation estimate used for the default chronology assumes that the flow-model is correct and infers accumulation from the known age-intervals between the gas ties. This leads to considerably larger changes in accumulation which may nonetheless be understandable given the distinctively high Holocene precipitation regime that prevails at Law Dome. In addition, dust concentration data show a larger LGM to Holocene decrease at LD than Vostok. If relative flux changes at the two sites are similar, then the exaggerated dilution at LD is consistent with a large interglacial accumulation shift.

Trapped gas measurements were made in France: CH4 measurements at LGGE, Grenoble and d18Oair measurements at LSCE, Saclay. Both analyses were conducted using a wet extraction procedure to release the air of the ice and followed by an injection into a gas chromatograph (CH4 measurement) or by a mass spectrometer isotopic analysis (d18Oair measurements). Both analyses were conducted using established procedures (S10,S11). The methane analytical uncertainty is plus or minus 20 ppbv with values were obtained on a single measurement (in which the sample was exhausted) and are presented on the LGGE scale which differs slightly from the NOAA scale but is well calibrated against it: LGGE = 1.02*NOAA (S12). The d18Oair values arise from means of duplicate measurements (except for one point with an obvious experimental problem, 1127.492 m depth). The analytical precision for d18Oair is around 0.05 ppt with a mean reproducibility of about 0.1 ppt.

d18Oice measurements were made in Hobart and have an analytical precision of approximately 0.1 ppt. The results are expressed using the conventional reference of VSMOW (Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water).

Public Summary
Regions of Antarctica are undergoing significant change in response to the Earth's changing climate. This project will provide a state of the art contemporary insight into the changing behaviour of the Totten drainage basin in East Antarctica - an area of vital importance in understanding ice/ocean/atmosphere and climate interactions in the Australian region of Antarctica. We will estimate the contribution of the Totten Glacier drainage basin to present-day sea level rise and simultaneously provide a critical validation of the European Space Agency (ESA) CryoSat-2 satellite mission over this region.

Project #3121 investigated the mass balance of the Totten basin and provided an Australian contribution to the validation of CryoSat-2 data over Law Dome and the Totten Glacier. With field seasons in 2010/11 and 2011/12, the project gathered a range of in situ data using field and airborne data collection techniques. These data include geodetic quality GPS observations from up to 6 quasi-permanent GPS sites from which ice velocity, tropospheric water vapour and in some cases, tidal motion are derived. These sites were equipped with temperature and atmospheric pressure sensors, and in some cases, acoustic snow accumulation sensors. GPS equipped skidoo surveys were undertaken over the survey region on Law Dome to facilitate the generation of a validation surface to compare against airborne LiDAR and ASIRAS based DEMs. In the 2011/12 season, AWI collaborators achieved 4 days of survey flights in Polar-6, obtaining LiDAR and ASIRAS data over specific flight lines spanning Law Dome and the Totten Glacier.

Project objectives:
This project will provide a state-of-the-art contemporary insight into the most recent changes in the surface elevation of the Totten drainage basin in East Antarctica, whilst simultaneously providing a critical and unique contribution to the calibration and validation of the new European Space Agency (ESA) CryoSat-2 satellite mission and the Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) LiDAR/RADAR system. The present-day mass balance change of Antarctica plays a key role in understanding the effects of global warming on the Earth system, in particular the contribution of melting Antarctic ice to present-day sea level rise. The Totten Glacier is known to be undergoing significant surface lowering and is perhaps the most significant basin in the East Antarctic (e.g., Shepherd and Wingham, 2007). The basin itself drains approximately 1/8th of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS) and, as a marine-based system, is analogous to the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) whose changing mass balance dominates the Antarctic contribution to global sea level rise(Lemke et al., 2007). The TOT-Cal project will independently lead Australian research in understanding the contribution of Antarctic ice to changing sea-levels by focusing new data on this key drainage basin of international scientific interest. Importantly, this region can be reached with relative ease by AAD logistics - it is located literally at the doorstep of the Australian Casey station, in close proximity to the Wilkins intercontinental airstrip. With international interest focused on this region, this project provides a showcase of AAD short-stay logistics in support of vital time-critical research and a major new ESA satellite mission that will undoubtedly play a major role in cryospheric science into the future.

The TOT-Cal project will draw upon key resources and personnel within the University of Tasmania (UTAS), Australian National University (ANU), Laboratoire d'Etudes en Geophysique et Oceanographie Spatiales (LEGOS, France), Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO, USA) and the AAD, requiring the collection and analysis of field based, airborne and satellite data over a multi-season campaign. It builds upon and extends related past, existing and planned Australian Antarctic Science (AAS), Australian Research Council (ARC) and International Polar Year (IPY) projects, addressing three specific questions:

1) What is the present-day mass balance of the Totten drainage basin and what is its contribution to global sea level change? This will be assessed through a combination of airborne LiDAR/RADAR observations, satellite altimetry observations including Seasat (1978), Geosat (1985-1989), ERS-1 (1992-1996), ERS-2 (1995-2005), Envisat-RA2 (2002 to present), ICESat (2003-present) and CryoSat-2 (expected launch 2009), space gravity observations (GRACE), along with ground-based validation experiments.

2) What are the accuracies and uncertainty characteristics of the altimetry measurement systems? (In other words, what is the expected accuracy of the altimetry-derived mass balance estimates?) With an emphasis on the new CryoSat-2 and AAD LiDAR/RADAR systems, this will be assessed through repeated ground and airborne experiments, providing direct contribution to the CryoSat-2 international Calibration, Validation and Retrieval Team (CVRT), whilst also providing an important cross-calibration of synchronous ICESat, Envisat and CryoSat-2 data. Of particular focus will be the understanding of the different surface interactions between the incident radar and laser waveforms (both satellite and airborne) with the surface snow/ice characteristics (topography, firn, seasonal changes, etc).

3) What is the magnitude of the present-day Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA) in the region that needs to be removed from the space-based geodetic observations in order to estimate mass balance using a space geodetic approach? Present uncertainty in the magnitude of GIA is a dominant error source in the mass balance error budget and requires an analysis of recent models and in-situ geodetic evidence in order to fully understand and minimise this error contribution.

Each of the objectives set out above will be assessed with data acquired over the coming three summer seasons, leading into participating in the larger period of logistics support around the Totten Glacier in 2011/12. This also enables this project to provide state-of-the-art estimates of surface lowering to the Australian AAD/ACECRC modelling team (R.Warner et al) for integration into dynamic ice models in the subsequent years of this project. These estimates will be fundamental in improving conventional forward ice models which to date, are not able to predict the observed changes in the Totten Glacier (van der Veen et al. 2008). The timing of the work outlined in this proposal is critical given the CryoSat-2 launch (expected late 2009) and the impending conclusion of the GRACE mission, this research needs to be undertaken now for the field seasons indicated in order to maximise the scientific impact and provide the necessary complement to other planned AAS projects that will operate over the same future field seasons. 

Public summary of the season progress:
2010/11 was the first field season for this project. Valuable GPS field data were acquired in the Law Dome and Totten Glacier regions to assist with providing an Australian contribution to the validation of the CryoSat-2 ice monitoring satellite mission, and to further understand ice shelf/ocean interactions and climate change in this region. Planned airborne surveys by the German AWI Polar-5 aircraft were unable to be completed due to poor weather. Collaboration with the 'Investigating the Cryospheric Evolution of the Central Antarctic Plate' project (ICECAP - UTexas) yielded important airborne scanning laser altimeter elevation data over the Law Dome site.</description>

Terrestrial vegetation in Antarctica is restricted to isolated populations of  mosses, lichens and algae, with a few higher plants on subantarctic islands.  Little is known of the biodiversity, origins or dispersal of these plants, and current conservation measures are based mainly on their local abundance.

Further data for Macquarie Island and Casey station between 2000 and 2007 were added in 2007.

Accession numbers for samples collected in the Prince Charles Mountains were added in 2012.

This project will investigate:

(1) the extent of genetic diversity in Antarctic and subantarctic plant populations, especially mosses,
(2) the probable origins and colonisation history of these plants,
(3) the effect of increased UV-B irradiation on genetic variability in mosses, and
(4) the utility of molecular taxonomy techniques for identification of Antarctic organisms.

This will provide a sound basis for development of practical conservation strategies, and baseline information from which to monitor effects of human impacts and climate change on the fragile ecosystems.

The downloadable data contain a list of locations from which the specimens were collected as well as Genbank sequence and accession numbers. Note that not all of the samples may be publicly accessible in Genbank as yet (as of May 2007).

The samples were kept frozen at -20 degrees Celsius.

This project is also related to ASAC projects 1041 and 2153 (ASAC_1041 and ASAC_2153).

Samples collected for this project were also used in ASAC project 2545 (ASAC_2545).

Project objectives: The project objectives, as stated in the project application round 2008/09, appear below:
The main aim of this project is to apply techniques of molecular genetics to investigations of plant biodiversity and responses to environmental change in Antarctica. The project has been very successful so far, with well over 20 publications, and will continue to concentrate on four main areas:

i) moss diversity, dispersal, and evolution in Antarctica and subantarctic islands,
ii) higher plant diversity, origins and dispersal on subantarctic islands,
iii) plant adaptation and genetic responses to climate change in Antarctica, and
iv) molecular taxonomy to assist rapid identification of Antarctic species, especially mosses, as there is now a significant database of gene sequences available for comparative analysis.

This project has been funded previously, and has been very productive so far. Therefore we are applying for a renewal of the project for a further three years, to complete the research already under way, and to finalise and submit additional manuscripts for publication, in order to obtain maximum benefit from the research already initiated and results already obtained.

The overall objectives have not been changed, except to include utilisation of our excellent database of DNA sequence information for further research. Now that the initial stages of this project are complete, with over twenty papers published in recognised international journals on the genetic diversity of Antarctic plants, we have started to build on this sound framework by investigating DNA sequences of individual genes and by analysis of plant adaptation to environmental change.

This project will provide information on several species of moss in different habitats and at different latitudes that will be important to international programs investigating adaptation to environmental change in the Antarctic. Similar techniques will also be used, as appropriate, to investigate other Antarctic and subantarctic organisms (especially, but not exclusively, plants) in collaboration with other Antarctic research scientists.

Specifically, the objectives for the next few years are:

1. To continue to assess the extent of genetic diversity within and between moss
populations in different regions of continental Antarctica. This will provide information on the level of biodiversity in these terrestrial Antarctic plants, which is required for (a) development of effective conservation and management strategies, and (b) minimisation of human impacts and (c) understanding responses and adaptation to climate change.

2. To continue to investigate the origins and mechanisms of dispersal of Antarctic and subantarctic mosses. This will assist in determining (a) the moss colonisation history of Antarctica, (b) which populations are most in need of protection, and (c) likely sources of colonisation on newly exposed ground e.g. with glacial retreat.

3. To provide systematic baseline data from which to assess and predict changes in Antarctic vegetation dynamics due to human impacts and climate change. This objective will include assessment of the natural rates of somatic mutation in Antarctic mosses, both in the past, by analysis of long shoots 50 years old (or more), and in the present by analysis of current growth which is already exposed to increased UV-B irradiation. The fascinating and exciting possibility of analysing mutational history within living plants (without killing the plant) is probably an opportunity uniquely available in Antarctic mosses, due to their unusual combination of genetic, physiological and environmental characteristics.

4. To build on research already done in this project, to test the hypothesis (based on results obtained) that moss genetic variation is greater in the Australian Antarctic Territory and subantarctic islands than in the Ross Sea region, and to investigate whether this is correlated with latitude and climate change (especially increased UV-B irradiation).

5. To use similar genetic techniques to (a) assess levels of genetic variability, (b) analyse genetic responses to climate change and (c) assist in resolving taxonomic uncertainties in a range of Antarctic and subantarctic plants, including algae and higher plants. Some of these have already been collected, some have been sequenced for individual genes, and/or subjected to RAPD population analysis, and others will be collected if necessary to supplement existing collections during future expeditions.

Taken from the 2008-2009 Progress Report:

Progress against objectives:
Good progress has been made with this project. Analysis of DNA sequencing results for both mosses and higher plants has continued this year. Several papers are nearing completion on these results. These results and publications are in line with the objectives of the project. 

Taken from the 2009-2010 Progress Report:

Progress against objectives:
Good progress has again been made with the project this season, with the main focus continuing towards completion of publications.
We have continued to analyse moss DNA sequence data for many different Antarctic and subantarctic moss samples, and are using this information for taxonomic and phylogenetic comparisons.
We have published new records of moss species on Heard Island, and new mosses recorded in the Vestfold Hills and Prince Charles Mountains are being prepared for publication.
We are continuing to analyse the ITS gene sequences from subantarctic higher plants such as several grass species, to determine their dispersal patterns.
We are also using DNA sequence information to analyse the extent of genetic diversity within moss species, and to compare populations from different Antarctic locations.</description>

New information about the flow properties of ice has been included to improve models. Comparisons with field observations and projections for sea-level and climate change will be investigated.

This metadata record is a parent metadata record for several child metadata records.  The child records contain information on:

1) Balance ice fluxes for the Antarctic Ice sheet
2) Balance ice velocities for the Antarctic Ice sheet

This work is now part of AAS (ASAC) project 2698.

Project objectives:
This multi-strand project aims to improve our understanding of the dynamical system of ice sheet and ice shelves and their place within the global climate system, with the major objectives of quantifying (a) the contribution of Antarctica to sea-level change, past, present and future, and (b) variations in the discharge of fresh-water into the Southern Ocean from ice shelf ocean interactions.
Specifically the project will
- assess the state of mass balance of individual drainage basins of East Antarctica, to improve understanding of the present contribution to global sea level rise
- improve understanding of the flow properties of ice through modelling, laboratory studies and analysis of remote sensing data, and incorporate this into dynamical models of the Antarctic ice sheet and ice shelves
- refine our quantitative understanding of the interaction between ice shelves and the underlying ocean and determine the influence of ice shelves on dynamics of the grounded ice sheet and hence on mass budgets and sea level change
- determine whether, and on what time scale, global warming might lead to irreversible change in the ice sheet-ice shelf system
- develop models of the ice sheet and ice shelves that can be linked to coupled atmosphere/ocean models (in an Earth Systems Model)

The project is constructed around the Science Strategy, season workplan, and the goals of the Antarctic Climate and Ecosystems CRC, as discussed under 3.1.2 below.
These are long term objectives, and this proposal seeks approval for a five year period culminating in the final round of ACE CRC research milestone/outputs in 2010 - and accordingly a workplan briefly indicating research for future years is included. 

Taken from the 2008-2009 Progress Report:
Public summary of the season progress:
Patterns of present day ice sheet flows have been contrasted with marine geological evidence of palaeo ice stream flow in the Amundsen Sea region of West Antarctica. Models predicting Antarctic ice sheet thickness have assisted aerogeophysical field programs. Several theoretical models of ice flow have been tested using ice deformation experiments and crystal microstructure measurements. Interpretation of our measured ice velocities for Mertz Glacier tongue is revealing dynamic interactions with surrounding fast ice, with implications for mutual stability. Development of an ice sheet system model continues, aimed at improving predictions of ice sheet evolution and sea level rise.

Progress against objectives:
- Antarctic Mass Balance

Roberts has improved the algorithm in his Lagrangian ice sheet balance flux computer code, vastly reducing the computational running time. 

New Antarctic balance fluxes have been calculated with the Lagrangian code using the latest available Antarctic ice sheet digital elevation models, including that of Bamber, Gomez-Dans and Griggs (2009) and for ice accumulation fields from a regional atmospheric modelling study (van de Berg, W., M. van den Broeke, C. Reijmer, and E. van Meijgaard, 2006. 'Reassessment of the Antarctic surface mass balance using calibrated output of a regional atmospheric climate model.' J. Geophys. Res. 111, D11104.), as well as earlier accumulation data compilations. 

New computed ice fluxes for the Amundsen Sea sector of West Antarctica advanced our collaboration with Frank Nitsche (Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory) , exploring the contrasts between present day ice sheet drainage, and paleo-ice sheet ice streams deduced from exploration of submarine troughs across the continental shelf.

Work comparing the new computed balance fluxes to the observed flows in the East Antarctic Ice Sheet to explore patterns of ice sheet mass imbalance at a regional scale is nearing completion.

Warner has also continued collaboration with Jaehyung Yu (Texas A and M University), Hongxing Liu (University of Cincinnati), Kenneth Jezek (Byrd Polar Research Center) and Jiahong Wen (Shanghai Normal University) on the mass balance of the drainage basins that feed the Amery ice shelf. The detailed analyses suggests the ice sheet catchment is in overall positive budget, partially offsetting losses elsewhere in Antarctica, but they also highlight a crucial need for ice flow estimates at the southernmost grounding zone to resolve conflicts with other published estimates.

- Ice Flow Properties

Warner continued to be involved with Prof W. F. Budd in finalizing revision of a major paper connecting ice deformation studies under combined compressive and shear stresses with a simple model for enhanced ice flow proposed for use in ice sheet modeling.

The investigation of crystal fabrics in glacial and marine ice samples from Amery Ice Shelf bore-holes (led by Adam Treverrow - UTAS) was prepared for publication (joint activity with AMISOR project- AAS 1164).

- Ice shelf - ocean interaction

Warner's mass balance collaboration with Yu, Liu, Jezek and Wen (above) also arrived at new broad-scale estimates of the rates of basal melting and freezing beneath the Amery ice shelf.

Ben Galton-Fenzi (UTAS) completed his Ph D thesis on 'Modelling ice shelf ocean interaction'. Warner advised regarding calculation of the accretion of marine ice beneath the Amery ice shelf from the ocean model basal melt/freeze pattern. Galton-Fenzi's results for the Amery ice shelf basal melt/freeze show good general agreement with estimates from glaciological observations when realistic present day climate forcing is applied in the model, and this ocean model development brings capacity to make projections of how ice shelves will respond to climate change much closer. His work also indicates the importance of treating frazil ice processes in marine ice accretion.

Warner and Galton-Fenzi commenced collaboration on coupling the current ACE CRC ice shelf dynamics model with the ROMS subglacial circulation ocean model.

- Ice shelf dynamics

Research on the dynamics of the floating Mertz Glacier Tongue (MGT) led by Robert Massom continued, particularly regarding the possible stabilising influence on the MGT of a large slab of thick and consolidated landfast multi-year sea ice ("fast ice") attached to its eastern edge. To date this has mainly involved interpretation of remote sensing work (also associated with AAS 3024 Remote Sensing of Near-Coastal Antarctic Sea Ice and Its Impacts on Ice Shelves and Ecosystems), but also provides material for future ice shelf modelling work. Ironically, after our study the main, more northerly, section of the MGT calved in February 2010. 

- Ice Sheet System model development

Progress continued on developing a next generation "full stress solution" model for treating the dynamics of ice sheet, ice stream and ice shelf flow. Roberts has developed a numerical method that allows for the efficient calculation of derivatives for arbitrarily distributed points. This method will be used in the ice-sheet model, allowing the selection of the discretisation grids for numerical solutions to be based on accurate implementation of boundary conditions rather than dictated by requirements for evaluating gradients. In the vertical, the grid will be of terrain following type - but with minimum grid spacing and automatic clustering in areas of high gradients.

In a separate modelling activity, Roberts has developed a novel scheme for interpolating between ice sheet thickness measurements, typically from Radio Echo Sounding (RES), drawing on ice flow trajectories, ice balance fluxes and earlier thickness inference modelling (Warner, R.C. and W.F. Budd (2000) Derivation of ice thickness and bedrock topography in data-gap regions over Antarctica. Annals of Glaciology, 31. 191-197). The skill of this interpolation scheme has been evaluated using the denser coverage from the first season of RES data gathered by the ICECAP international collaboration (see AAS 3103) over the region south of Casey station, encompassing the Aurora Subglacial Basin and Totten and Denman glacier streams. Warner and Roberts have recently applied this interpolation scheme to the generally sparse publicly available ice thickness data for the entire Antarctic continent, to produce a new view of the broad-scale subglacial landscape. We hope this scheme will be of value in the international effort (BEDMAP 2) to assemble a new ice thickness and bedrock dataset from existing and new IPY-era RES data.</description>

Variations to work plan or objectives:
An aerial survey of the Vestfold Hills and Rauer Islands was conducted in November 2009 to collect data on the distribution and abundance of Adelie penguins in the areas around Davis. This supports one of the projects stated goals of expanding the spatial scale of monitoring, and involved taking photographs from a helicopter along pre-defined transects. Counts from aerial photographs will enable an assessment of the current distribution of colonies throughout the Vestfold Hills and Rauer Islands. Density and abundance will also be assessed providing population estimates. Current estimates will be compared with aerial photography through the same region in previous decades, enabling an assessment of changes in the distribution and abundance of the meta-population. Planned ground surveys of islands off Davis were performed in November 2009 (Gardener Island). Aerial photography of the Adelie penguin colonies surveyed from the ground in a small section of Gardner island enabled an assessment of the accuracy of counts gained from both survey methods. Preliminary results from this small trial indicate considerable undercounting from aerial photos, and further assessment of bias may be needed in 2010/11.

We propose to expand the snow petrel monitoring program to include (1) measurement of breeding success from mountain sites inland from Mawson, (2) a regional survey of the snow petrel population across the islands in the Kista Strait off Mawson, (3) modifying existing methods of nest checking for improved measurement of breeding success, and (4) identifying the relationship between parental quality and habitat quality. 

Field work:
This season we performed a count of Adelie penguin sub-colonies on Gardener Island off Davis to ground truth aerial photography surveys. Ground surveys were also performed at a number of islands within the Rookeries group to the west of Mawson, and at the Robinson Islands the east of Mawson, to estimate population size and contribute to an assessment of temporal variation in abundance. Local islands around Mawson (Verner, Welch, Petersen and Klung) were also visited to count adults and / or chicks, and to maintain and download the automatic cameras installed on each island. The detailed monitoring program of Adelie penguins at Bechervaise Island, a CEMP long-term monitoring site, was continued and achieved all planned objectives. These included arrival counts, male and female attendance counts, as well as egg and chick counts to estimate hatching and breeding success. Satellite transmitters were deployed on 15 fledging Adelie penguins to track their winter foraging range.

Work on flying seabirds included surveys on numerous islands within the Kista Strait off Mawson, and the Robinson group east of Mawson. Double-observer surveys were performed at all visited sites to assess the detectability of crevice nesting species (snow petrels and Wilson's storm petrels). Regular checks of a large sample of snow petrel nest on Bechervaise island provided data on the proportion of nests occupied, nest attendance rates, hatching success and breeding success. 

Laboratory activity/analysis:
CCAMLR monitoring data are processed and submitted to CCAMLR in the winter following each field season. Analysis of population survey, breeding success, foraging and survival data is continually underway as evidenced by the many recent publications.</description>

The Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) aims to manage the harvesting of living resources in the Southern Ocean in a manner that is sustainable to the harvested species, dependent species and ecosystem processes. The krill fishery is one of the major fisheries in the Southern Ocean. Application of CCAMLR's policy in management of the krill fishery requires sound scientific information on both krill and krill-dependent (predator) species. This program aims to provide the scientific information on krill predators required by CCAMLR for sustainable management of the krill fishery through research, survey and monitoring activities.

Project objectives:
The Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) aims to manage the harvesting of living resources in the Southern Ocean in a manner that is sustainable to the harvested species, dependent species and ecosystem processes. The krill fishery is one of the major fisheries in the Southern Ocean. Application of CCAMLR's policy to management of the krill fishery requires sound scientific information on both krill and krill-dependent (predator) species. This program of work aims broadly to provide the scientific information on krill predators required by CCAMLR for sustainable management of the krill fishery in the Australian Antarctic Territory against a background of other impacts such as climate change, and compliments separate SOE projects aimed at krill itself.

This program is related to the previous multi-year project number 2205 (Adelie penguin research and monitoring in support of the CCAMLR Ecosystem Monitoring Project (CEMP)) but recognises and addresses recent developments in CCAMLR that include (i) the current development of a krill management procedure, (ii) a review of outputs from past CEMP work and recognition of the likely need to re-design CEMP to meet the needs of the new krill management procedure, and (iii) the need to estimate predator consumption of krill as part of the krill management procedure. Although the previous project 2205 focussed on Adelie penguins in the Mawson region exclusively, this new program will include consideration of additional species and regions to allow improvements in both ecosystem monitoring and estimation of krill consumption.

The program was approved in 2005 as a multi-year ASAC project with four major sub-programs or projects which have strong methodological and practical cross-linkages and overlap. The projects and their objectives are:

(1) Development of cost-effective methods for surveying and monitoring predator populations at the large spatial scales required by CCAMLR,
(2) Estimation of the abundance of krill predators in CCAMLR Statistical Areas 58.4.1 and 58.4.2 (which together span the width of the Australian Antarctic Territory),
(3) Assessment of spatio-temporal variability in predator performance parameters to enable the design of an effective and efficient monitoring program, and to examine metapopulation dynamics
(4) Continuation of selected aspects of project 2205 to (i) improve estimates and understanding of temporal variability and population dynamics and (ii) continue the application of CEMP.

We propose to continue these projects in 2008/09 and commence some additional projects. Projects (1) and (2) will be expanded beyond Adelie penguins to include some species of flying seabirds. Additional work related to the AAD's management of the Rookery Islands Specially Protected Area is proposed which would be undertaken in collaboration with the AADs environmental policy section, and aims to assess the status of the Southern Giant Petrel. It would be undertaken in conjunction with planned surveys of Adelie penguins and some flying seabird species in the Rookery Islands (project 2). Details of the work will be outlined in a separate proposal submitted by the AAD environmental policy section. A additional project is related to an IPY approved project focussing on Adelie penguins as indicators in the Southern Ocean. The objective of this new project is to co-ordinate some aspects of the work of Adelie penguin researchers around Antarctica to improve understanding of broad-scale processes in the Southern Ocean. A planning meeting in May 2007 had to be postponed until September 2007 and consequently it is not yet possible to outline the details of this project. We will provide project details as soon as possible after the September 2007 meeting and request that a late submission be accepted for this project.

Progress against objectives:

(1) Implementation and further development of cost-effective methods for surveying and monitoring predator populations at the large spatial scales required by CCAMLR.

Camera technology has been developed and is now being used to monitor Adelie penguin populations on several islands in the Mawson and Davis areas. Methods for cost-effective development of regional population size have also been developed and applied in the Mawson and Davis areas. Flying seabirds have been incorporated in the monitoring program by developing and implementing monitoring methods of snow petrel on Bechervaise Island.

(2) Estimation of the abundance of krill predators in CCAMLR Statistical Areas 58.4.1 and 58.4.2 (which together span the width of the Australian Antarctic Territory).

Aerial surveys were undertaken of Adelie penguin populations in the Vestfold Hills and Rauers Islands. Reconnaissance surveys of Adelie penguin distribution were conducted by the CASA aircraft between Casey and Mirny. Ground surveys of Adelie penguin populations were undertaken in the Mawson region

(3) Assessment of spatio-temporal variability in predator performance parameters to enable the design of an effective and efficient monitoring program, and to examine metapopulation dynamics.

Population surveys and the use of cameras at multiple sites in the Mawson area are providing data on Adelie penguin meta-population dynamics.

(4) Continuation of selected aspects of project 2205 to (i) improve estimates and understanding of temporal variability and population dynamics and (ii) continue the application of CEMP.

Measurement of Adelie penguin population size, foraging trip duration, breeding success and survival at Bechervaise Island continued in 2009/10

(5) Assessment of the winter foraging distribution of Adelie penguins.

Satellite trackers were successfully deployed on 15 fledgling Adelie penguins.</description>

            <description type="full">APIS data were collected between 1994 and 1999. This dataset also includes some historical data collected between 1985 and 1987. Both aerial and ship-board surveys were conducted. Studies on the behaviour of Pack-ice or Crabeater Seal (Lobodon carcinophagus) in the Southern Ocean and in the Australian Sector of Antarctica were also conducted as part of this study. Satellite tracking was used to determine their movement, durations on land and at sea, dive depths and dive duration etc. The four species of Antarctic pack ice seals (crabeater, leopard, Weddell, and Ross seals) are thought to comprise up to 50% or more of the world's total biomass of seals. As long-lived, top level predators in Southern Ocean ecosystems, pack ice seals are scientifically interesting because they can assist in monitoring shifts in ecosystem structure and function, especially changes that occur in sensitive polar areas in response to global climate changes. 
     
The APIS Program focuses on the ecological importance of pack ice seals and their interactions with physical and biotic features of their environment. This program is a collaborative, multi-disciplinary research initiative whose planning and implementation has involved scientists from more than a dozen countries. It is being developed and coordinated by the Group of Specialists on Seals of the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR), and represents an important contribution to SCAR's Antarctic Global Change Program. Australian researchers have undertaken an ambitious science program studying the distribution and abundance of pack ice seals in support of the APIS Program. An excellent overview of this work is provided at the Australian Antarctic Division's web site. The following paragraphs provide a brief progress report of some of that work through 1998. ======================================- 
     
Four years of developmental work have now been completed in preparation for the Australian contribution to the circumpolar survey that will take place in December 1998. Until recently the main effort has been directed towards designing and building a system for automatic data logging of line transect data by double observers. Two systems identical in concept have been designed for aerial survey and shipboard survey. The systems consist of a number of sighting guns and keypads linked to a central computer. The sightings guns are used to measure the exact time and angle of declination from the horizon of seals passing abeam of the survey platform. Also logged regularly (10 second intervals) are GPS position and altitude (aerial survey only). The aerial survey system also has an audio backup. The aerial survey system has been trialled over three seasons and the shipboard system over one season. Preliminary analysis of aerial data indicates that the essential assumption of the line transect method is badly violated, reinforcing the need for double observers. Assumption violation is likely to be less in shipboard survey, but assessment of the assumption of perfect sightability on the line is still important. User manuals have been written for both the aerial and shipboard systems. An aerial survey system is being constructed for use by BAS in the coming season. A backup manual system for aerial and shipboard survey has also been developed in the event of the automatic system failing. The aerial backup system uses the perspex sighting frame developed by the US. A database has been designed for storage and analysis of aerial and shipboard data. Importing of data is fast and easy, allowing post-survey analysis and review immediately after each day's survey effort. Aides for training observers have been developed. A video on species identification has been produced. A Powerpoint slide show has been designed to simulate aerial survey conditions and use of the automatic data logging system. Currently effort has been directed toward developing an optimal survey design. While a general survey plan is necessary, it must be flexible to deal with unpredictable ice and weather conditions. It is planned to use both the ship and two Sikorsky 76 helicopters as survey platforms. The ship will be used to survey into and out from stations, and inwards from the ice edge for approximately 60 miles. The helicopters will be used to survey southwards from the ship for distances up to 140 miles in favourable weather. Helicopters will fly in tandem, with transects 10 miles apart. Studies of crabeater seal haul-out behaviour have been conducted over the past four seasons. Twenty SLTDRs have been deployed in the breeding season (September-October). The length of deployments varies from a few days to 3 months. No transmissions have been received after mid-January, probably due to loss of instruments during the moult. Most instruments have transmitted data through the survey period of November-December. Haul-out behaviour is consistent between animals and years. However, five more instruments will be deployed in the survey season to ensure there is haul-out data concurrent with the survey effort. Some observations of penguins and whales were also made.

            <description type="full">The survey was undertaken to gain an understanding of the diversity of flora and fauna within Mount Bold Reservoir. To survey a variety of habitat types within the reserve and to survey sites within habitat types that represent the best quality and least disturbed areas within each habitat type. Survey was conducted October-November 2005.

Sites were selcted by considering past vegetation mapping to locate/identify diversity. Complete lists of plant species were obtained quadrat using Braun/ Blanquet cover abundance scores. 1 trapline was setup per site, as well as some bird watching. The Mount Bold Reservoir Reserve Biological Survey Survey is part of the Biological Survey of South Australia Program which is a series of systematic surveys conducted across the state between 1971 and the present with the broad aim of providing a baseline inventory of South Australia's flora and fauna biodiversity.</description>

            <description type="full">A progression of FIAs (foliation intersection/inflection axes preserved within porphyroblasts) in the foothills of the Colorado Rocky Mountains reveals four periods of staurolite growth and two growth phases each of cordierite and andalusite; these FIA based isograds migrated ~2.5 kms across the orogen. This progression of mineral development occurred about FIAs trending successively NE-SW, E-W, SE-NW and NNE-SSW. Granitoids were emplaced during both periods of orogenesis in the surrounding region but have no direct relationship to the isograds. Isograd migration took place away from a heat source to the WNW and combined with the lack of relationship to pluton boundaries to the north and south suggests that the latter rocks were not the heat source for metamorphism but rather product of it. A final period of andalusite, cordierite and fibrolitic sillimanite grew over the matrix foliation and consequently, no FIA was determined for it; the isograds for this last period of mineral growth lie sub-parallel to those mapped by previous workers. A strong correlation between the distribution of FIA trends and the axial trace of all folds present in the area suggests that pockets of low strain occur due to deformation partitioning, in spite of, or perhaps because of, the 4 successive changes in bulk shortening direction. These pockets preserve folds in the orientation in which they formed from subsequent rotation or destruction. They provide remarkable confirmation of the veracity of the FIA data and indeed reveal that such data can be used to determine successions of fold development from regional maps at which scale many overprinting criteria cannot be applied. FlAs (foliation intersection/inflection axes preserved within porphyroblasts) in garnet, staurolite, andalusite and cordierite from PreCambrian rocks in the northern Colorado Rocky Mountains reveal 4 periods of growth about axes trending NE-SW, E-W, SE-NW and NNESSW during an overall prograde path. The growth of garnet was always followed by staurolite for each of the 4 FIA sets with andalusite and cordierite following staurolite during development of the last 2 sets. Thermodynamic modelling in the MnNCKFMASH system reveals that well documented episodic growth occurred over a similar bulk compositional range and PT path for each FIA in the succession. The intersection of Ca, Mn, and Fe isopleths in garnet cores containing FIA set 1 indicate that growth of this mineral phase began at 540-550&amp;amp;deg;C and 3.8-4.0 kbars. Similarly, the intersection of Ca, Mn, and Fe isopleths in garnet cores containing FIA sets 2 and set 3 indicate that these rocks never got above 4 kbars throughout the Colorado orogeny. Indeed, they remained at approximately the same depth with the onset of the much younger Berthoud orogeny, when the pressure decreased slightly as porphyroblasts formed with inclusion trails preserving FIA set 4. A slightly clockwise P-T path occurred for both orogenies. In-situ dating of monazite grains preserved as inclusions within foliations defining FlAs (foliation inflection/intersection axes preserved within porphyroblasts) contained within garnet, staurolite, andalusite and cordierite porphyroblasts provides a chronology of ages that matches the FIA succession for the Big Thompson region of the northern Colorado Rocky Mountains. FIA sets I, 2 and 3 trending NE-SW, E-W and SE-NW formed at 1760.5&amp;amp;plusmn;9.7, 1719.7&amp;amp;plusmn;6.4 and 1674&amp;amp;plusmn;1l Ma respectively. For 3 samples where garnet first grew during just one of each of these FlAs, the intersection of Ca, Mg, and Fe isopleths in their cores indicate that these rocks never got above 4 kbars throughout the Colorado orogeny. Furthermore, they remained around approximately the same depth for ~250 million years to the onset of the younger Belthoud orogeny at 1415&amp;amp;plusmn;16 Ma when the pressure decreased slightly as porphyroblasts formed with inclusion trails preserving FlA set 4 trending NNE-SSW. No porphyroblast growth occurred during the intervening ~250 million years of quiescence, even though the PT did not change over this period. This confirms microstructural evidence gathered over the past 25 years that crenulation deformation at the scale of a porphyroblast is required for reactions to re-initiate and enable further growth. Microstructural measurements of FIAs (foliation intersection/inflection axes preserved in porphyroblasts) in staurolite reveal at least 3 periods of growth in the Proterozoic Colorado frontal range and 5 in Palaeozoic Western Maine. Monazite inclusions in staurolite have an absolute age of 1 765&amp;amp;plusmn;23 Ma (FIA I), 1718.8&amp;amp;plusmn;6.9 Ma (FIA 2), and 1674&amp;amp;plusmn;16 Ma (FIA 3) in Colorado, and 408&amp;amp;plusmn;10 Ma (FIA 2), 388&amp;amp;plusmn;8.8 Ma (FIA 3), 372.1&amp;amp;plusmn;5.5 Ma (FIA 4), and 352.7&amp;amp;plusmn;4.2 Ma (FIA 5) in Maine, confirming the multiple periods of deformation and metamorphism indicated by the FIA succession in each region. Thermodynamic modeling in the NCMnKFMASH system reveals that this episodic growth of staurolite occurred over a similar bulk compositional range and PT path. Multiple phases of growth by one reaction in the same and adjacent rocks in both regions strongly suggest that PT and X are not the only factors controlling the commencement and cessation of metamorphic reactions. The FIAs preserved by the staurolite porphyroblasts indicate that each stage of growth in both areas occurred during deformation and indicate that the local partitioning of deformation at the scale of a porphyroblast was the controlling factor on whether or not the reaction took place.</description>
            <description type="brief">Using microstructural, foliation intersection axes (FIAs), thermodynamic modeling (McNCKFMASH) and chemical relationships, this research investigates in detail the metamorphic and deformation processes and the progression in the distribution of various index minerals phases (garnet, staurolite, andalusite and cordierite) in the Big Thompson Canyon region, Colorado Rocky Mountains, USA. This region forms part of a Proterozoic orogenic belt in the southwestern USA and provides a classic example of a large high-T-low-P terrane.</description>

The boundary conditions included appropriate greenhouse forcing using CO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; equivalents and orbital parameters.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p class=&amp;quot;p1&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Climatologies of sea surface temperature, sea surface salinity, and x and y vectors of sea surface wind stresses were produced by both the PI and LGM coupled experiments and were used to force the ocean general circulation model. Additional climatologies of sea ice fractional cover, sea surface wind speeds, and net incident short-wave radiation were important for forcing the biogeochemical model. These climatologies are available.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p class=&amp;quot;p1&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Also available are the three-dimensional global annual averages of oceanic properties for both PI and LGM climates. These include temperature, salinity, oxygen, apparent oxygen utilisation, dissolved inorganic carbon, alkalinity, calcite saturation state, aragonite saturation state, phosphate and iron concentrations.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

            <description type="brief">Melbourne's Biggest Family Album Collection consists of copies of over 1100 photographs taken by past and present Melbourne residents depicting scenes of what they consider to be an accurate portrayal of life in Melbourne. The images range from the mid 19th century and through to 1980, and were collected by Museum Victoria in 2006-2007.</description>
            <description type="full">Melbourne's Biggest Family Album was modelled on the successful Biggest Family Album in Australia (BFA) project, undertaken by Museum Victoria in the 1980s. The Melbourne project, undertaken in 2006-2007, aimed to enrich Museum Victoria's collections by sourcing and capturing images of Melbourne held in family collections. The project collected copies of over 1,000 images ranging from the mid 19th century and through to 1980, and was restricted to images within the boundaries of 'Greater Melbourne' as defined by Melways in 2006. The project surveyed regions which were not sampled in the original BFA project, such as specific Melbourne suburbs, and increased the range of content themes used to select images for coping. Like the original BFA project, Melbourne's BFA was conducted to increase the representation of images of everyday life, taken by ordinary people, in Victoria's State Collection. The images collected as part of the project have opened up many new perspectives on Melbourne's history, and provide evocative, personal insights into life in Melbourne from the late 19th century to the early 21st century. More than just records of individual family life, these photographs are a wonderful resource for exploring the history of communities, places and events. Featuring approximately 170 Melbourne suburbs, the photographs depict people of all ages, from a range of cultures. Melbournians are captured at home, on the streets, working, celebrating, travelling, playing and mourning. These photographs also show some of our city's hidden histories - people travelling on public transport, hanging out their washing, browsing inside shops, sleeping in their bedrooms, and washing in the bathroom. Over 120 contributors responded enthusiastically to the invitation to share their photographs, with most bringing several generations of family photographs with them. Contributors also often came along with a family member who could help with accurately documenting the photographs. They brought with them not just photographs, but stories, emotions and a passion about their place in history.</description>

            <description type="notes">This dataset was used to describe the migratory movements of pygmy blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus brevicauda) between Australia and Indonesia. The abstract from the resulting manuscript follows:
In Australian waters during the austral summer, pygmy blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus brevicauda) occur predictably in two distinct feeding areas off western and southern Australia. As with other blue whale subspecies, outside the austral summer their distribution and movements are poorly understood. In order to describe the migratory movements of these whales, we present the satellite telemetry derived movements of eleven individuals tagged off western Australia over two years. Whales were tracked from between 8 and 308 days covering an average distance of 3,0096892 km (mean 6 se; range: 832 km–14,101 km) at a rate of 21.9460.74 km per day (0.09 km–455.80 km/day). Whales were tagged during March and April and ultimately migrated northwards post tag deployment with the exception of a single animal which remained in the vicinity of the Perth Canyon/Naturaliste Plateau for its eight day tracking period. The tagged whales travelled relatively near to the Australian coastline (100.061.7 km) until reaching a prominent peninsula in the north-west of the state of Western Australia (North West Cape) after which they travelled offshore (238.0613.9 km). Whales reached the northern terminus of their migration and potential breeding grounds in Indonesian waters by June. One satellite tag relayed intermittent information to describe aspects of the southern migration from Indonesia with the animal departing around September to arrive in the subtropical frontal zone, south of western Australia in December. Throughout their migratory range, these whales are exposed to impacts associated with industry, fishing and vessel traffic. These movements therefore provide a valuable tool to industry when assessing potential interactions with pygmy blue whales and should be considered by conservation managers and regulators when mitigating impacts of development. This is particularly relevant for this species as it continues to recover from past exploitation.</description>

            <description type="lineage">Fights were documented during the day from 2.5 hours before low tide to up to 4.5 hours after low tide, between owners and floaters (natural and artificial). Crabs which lost fights late in the low tide period were rehoused before the tide came in by placing them in empty burrows or in artificially created burrows. 

Major claw length (manus+pollex) and carapace width of each male were measured to the nearest 0.1mm using dial callipers. Fight duration was either timed in the field using a handheld stopwatch and recorded to the nearest 0.01s, or after the event using a Sony Digital Video Camera.</description>
            <description type="lineage">187 fights were documented during the day from 2.5 hours before low tide to up to 4.5 hours after low tide. Documented fights included naturally occurring fights between owners and floaters, and fights between artificial floaters created by capturing and releasing floaters or owners from their burrows. There is no difference in the fighting ability of these three types of floaters, so their fights were pooled. A standard set of data was collected for each fight. For each fight the date, time, the type of floater, and winner were recorded. Additionally, all crabs were measured, and figh duration and phases recorded.  The winner is the male that owns the territory at the end of a fight. The loser is the crab which walks away at the end of the fight. A fight was considered over when: a) the loser walked &amp;gt;30cm away, b) travelled past two other males territories, c) entered another burrow, or d) started another fight.

Parameters: Date, ltidet (time of diurnal low tide), hightideht (high tide height of the tide which follows the diurnal low tide), rtimet (time of the fight), tsltide (number of minutes since low tide), ctype (condition, NF=natural floater, RF=removed floater, RO=removed owner), winner, cara (intruder carapace width - mm), chel (inturder cheliped / claw length - mm), ocara (owner carapace width - mm), ochel (owner cheliped / claw length -mm), actions observed (P=push, B=burrow, G=grapple, F=flick, D=dig, TB=true burrow fighting), dura (duration of fight - seconds), digdura (dig duration - seconds), sizediff ( size difference between owner and intruder claws - mm).</description>

            <description type="full">Resource owners generally win contests against intruders, a phenomenon referred to as the 'Owner Advantage' (OA). Uca mjoebergi is a typical fiddler crab that is highly sociable, territorial and lives in mixed sex colonies on intertidal mudflats. Burrows are used in territory defence, for mating, and as refuge from predators and environmental stresses. Fights are common between owners and floating males who battle for ownership of the territory and burrow. 

Experiments were conducted from 28th Sept - 30 Dec 2006 at the lower reaches of Ludmilla Creek within East Point Reserve, 5km North of Darwin, NT. This experiment was designed to determine if owner advantage in the fiddler crab Uca mjoebergi is related to motivation. This was designed on the premise that at low tide owners are thought of as being more motivated than floaters in contests because they have invested in the territory. It was thought that as the tide comes in, the motivational asymmetry is likely to be reduced as both are increasingly motivated to win the contest and the territory. 

The results indicate that as the tide came in owners, not floaters, were more likely to win contests, and size difference also had a significant effect on who won. The result is interesting because it is the first direct test of the role of motivation in contests, and it is a direct contradiction to established theory.</description>

            <description type="lineage">'High quality' territories (n=25) and 'natural' territories were created in 0.5m x 0.5m plots on the mudflat. 'High quality' territories were manufactured by adding 3.5-4g powered fish food (OSI Marine Aquatic Flake Food and Aquasonic Complete Premium Marine Fish Food) dissolved in approx. 70ml of tap water. To the natural territories tap water only was added. 

Treatments were applied to the plots and a 5cm margin around the outside to combat edge effects. Treatments were applied every day before low tide for three days before data collection. 

Fights were documented between owners and floaters which were created by capturing owners from their burrows and releasing them into the plots. Plots were uncaged to ensure natural emigration and immigration but were temporarily  caged during the release and fight with the owner. Cages were made from mesh (6.5cm wide, 0.8cm mesh size), and clear plastic strips lined the top 4.0cm of the cage on the inside and outside. Cages were dug 1-2cm into the mud. Only one fight was recorded per plot. 

Floaters were released from shallow depressions dug in the mud. The depression was covered with a thin piece of plastic, which was weighed on top with mud and had fishing line attached to it. The fishing line was pulled from a distance exposing the depression and releasing the crab. 

Major claw length (manus+pollex) and carapace width of each male were measured to the nearest 0.1mm using dial callipers. Fight duration was timed using a handheld stopwatch and recorded to the nearest 0.01s. This was measured after the event using a Sony Digital Video Camera.</description>

The results revealed that owners won more contests in 'high quality' territories than in 'natural' territories but this difference was not significant. Although owners win more contests in 'High quality' territories, the lack of significance may indicate only a small asymmetry between owners and floaters. It is possible that owners and floaters have similar abilities to perceive the food availability and be similar in motivational level.</description>

            <description type="lineage">Fights were documented and compared between owners with differing residency times and activity levels. Circular plots were marked out (diameter 55-65cm, n=11) on the mudflat and caged. Cages were made from mesh (6.5cm wide, 0.8cm mesh size), and clear plastic strips lined the top 4cm of the cage on the inside and outside. Cages were dug 1-2cm into the mud. To establish owners with known residency duratons I released and monitored individually marked males to the cages. The burrow was marked with a numbered flag, and the time recorded. Individually marked males were introduced repeatedly into plots for several days, creating plots with males with a range of known residency durations.

Fights were documented between newly introduced marked males and resident marked males (n=30). All losing males were removed to avoid pseudoreplication. 

Residency duration were recorded for the owner, as was his activity. This information was grouped into four indices: 'cage duration' and 'residency duration' equate to tenure in the area, while 'open duration' and 'surface duration' were used as measures of neighbour relations.

Major claw length (manus+pollex) and carapace width of each male were measured to the nearest 0.1mm using dial callipers. Fight duration was timed using a handheld stopwatch and recorded to the nearest 0.01s after the event using a Sony Digital Video Camera.</description>
            <description type="lineage">Fights were documented between floaters and owners with residency durations of 10mins to 3days; this range encompases 85% of the variation in the population. A standard set of data was collected for each fight. For each fight the date, time, the type of floater, and winner were recorded. Additionally, all crabs were measured, and fight duration and phases recorded.  The winner is the male that owns the territory at the end of a fight. The loser is the crab which walks away at the end of the fight. A fight was considered over when: a) the loser walked &amp;gt;30cm away, b) travelled past two other males territories, c) entered another burrow, or d) started another fight.

Residency duration were recorded for the owner, as was his activity. This information was grouped into four indices: 'cage duration' and 'residency duration' equate to tenure in the area, while 'open duration' and 'surface duration' were used as measures of neighbour relations.

            <description type="full">Resource owners generally win contests against intruders, a phenomenon referred to as the 'Owner Advantage' (OA). Uca mjoebergi is a typical fiddler crab that is highly sociable, territorial and lives in mixed sex colonies on intertidal mudflats. Burrows are used in territory defence, for mating, and as refuge from predators and environmental stresses. Fights are common between owners and floating males who battle for ownership of the territory and burrow. 

Experiments were conducted from 28th Sept - 30 Dec 2006 at the lower reaches of Ludmilla Creek within East Point Reserve, 5km North of Darwin, NT. Previous experiments have revealed that owners win more contests than floaters because they are more motivated. This experiment was designed to test if owners are more motivated than floaters because they have invested more in neighbour relations.

The results indicate that the total amount of time a male has been present in a territory did not affect his fighting succes. The amount of time he spent on the surface or with his burrow open represented the time he could interact with neighbours, had a marginally significant influence on fighting success. Establishing relations with neighbours appear to convey at least a small increase in motivation leading to a weak fighting advantage.</description>

            <description type="lineage">Contests were documented between prior owners and territory owners fighting with and without the use of their burrow. Floaters were created by removing owners from their burrows and releasing them onto the mudflat. Burrows were blocked by sliding a metal blade across the burrow entrance 0.5-1.5cm below the surface of the mudflat, immediately before the fight. As a control the metal blade was slid under the mud but stopped short of the burrow in those fights denoted as unblocked. The metal blade used in these manipulations was attached to the end of a 1.5m long wooden pole. The pole allowed us to perform the manipulation from a distance and avoid scaring crabs during fights. 

Major claw length (manus+pollex) and carapace width of each male were measured to the nearest 0.1mm using dial callipers. Fight duration was timed in the field using a handheld stopwatch and recorded to the nearest 0.01s.</description>

Experiments were conducted from 28th Sept - 30 Dec 2006 at the lower reaches of Ludmilla Creek within East Point Reserve, 5km North of Darwin, NT.
This experiment was designed to determine if owner advantage in the fiddler crab Uca mjoebergi, is due to a mechanical advanatage. Possible advantages come from the ability of the owner to utilise the burrow when fighting. For example, owners can retreat into their burrow and block the entrance using the 'flat-claw' defence. In addition to this, fiddler crabs may also gain advantage by using the burrow shaft during fights, producing greater leverage for their enlarged claw. This was tested by pitching fights between prior owners and resident owners with either their burrow blocked or open. Owners with unblocked burrows won 88% of contests, and those with blocked burrows won 38% of contests. This is a significance difference and infers that owners have a strong mechanical advantage.</description>

            <description type="lineage">80 fights were documented in total. To standardise the experiments naturally occurring floaters and naturally occurring territory owners were captured and released individually onto the mudflat (40 of each category). Crabs were observed until their first fight with a resident territory owner. 

Major claw length (manus+pollex) and carapace width of each male were measured to the nearest 0.1mm using dial callipers. Prior floaters and prior owners were caught and measured before their fights, while natural owners were caught and measured after their fights. 

Fight duration was either timed in the field using a handheld stopwatch and recorded to the nearest 0.01s, or using a Sony Digital Video Camera after the event.</description>
            <description type="lineage">80 fights were documented in total. 40 fights were documented between captured naturally occuring floaters and resident territory owners. 40 fights were also documented between captured naturally occuring territory owners and resident territory owners. A standard set of data was collected for each fight. For each fight the date, time, the type of floater, and winner were recorded. Additionally, all crabs were measured, and the fight duration and phases recorded.  The winner is the male that owns the territory at the end of a fight. The loser is the crab which walks away at the end of the fight. A fight was considered over when: a) the loser walked &amp;gt;30cm away, b) travelled past two other males territories, c) entered another burrow, or d) started another fight.

Parameters: Datatype (1=field, 2=video), encounter ID, date, ltidet (time of diurnal low tide), hightideht (high tide height of the tide which follows the diurnal low tide), rtimet (time of the fight), tsltide (number of minutes since low tide), ctype (condition, RF=removed floater, RO=removed owner), winner, cara (intruder carapace width - mm), chel (inturder cheliped / claw length - mm), ocara (owner carapace width - mm), ochel (owner cheliped / claw length -mm), actions observed (P=push, B=burrow, G=grapple, F=flick, D=dig, TB=true burrow fighting), dura (duration of fight - seconds), digdura (dig duration - seconds), sizediff ( size difference between owner and intruder claws - mm).</description>

            <description type="full">Resource owners generally win contests against intruders, a phenomenon referred to as the 'Owner Advantage' (OA). Uca mjoebergi is a typical fiddler crab that is highly sociable, territorial and lives in mixed sex colonies on intertidal mudflats. Burrows are used in territory defence, for mating, and as refuge from predators and environmental stresses. Fights are common between owners and floating males who battle for ownership of the territory and burrow. 

Experiments were conducted from 28th Sept - 30 Dec 2006 at the lower reaches of Ludmilla Creek within East Point Reserve, 5km North of Darwin, NT.
This experiment was designed to determine if owner advantage in the fiddler crab Uca mjoebergi, was due to floaters being poorer fighters for their size compared with burrow owners. This was achieved by comparing the fights between owners - prior floaters, with the fights between owners - prior territory owners. In both cases owners won the majority of fights; winning 92.5% of the their fights against prior owners, and 90% of their fights against prior floaters. Therefore prior floaters do not appear to be poorer fighters.</description>

            <description type="full">&amp;lt;p class=&amp;quot;p1&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;s1&amp;quot;&amp;gt;The Hobday et al. (2016) definition detects marine heatwaves from daily seawater temperature time series. A marine heatwave is defined as a &amp;quot;discrete prolonged anomalously warm water event at a particular location&amp;quot; with each of those terms (anomalously warm, prolonged, discrete) quantitatively defined and justified for the marine context. Specifically, &amp;quot;discrete&amp;quot; implies the marine heatwave is an identifiable event with clear start and end dates, &amp;quot;prolonged&amp;quot; means it has duration of at least five days, and &amp;quot;anomalously warm&amp;quot; means the water temperature is above a climatological threshold, defined here to be the seasonally-varying 90th percentile. Marine heatwaves are therefore identified as periods of time when temperatures were above the threshold for at least five consecutive days; and two successive events with a break of two days or less between then were considered a single continuous event. The seasonally varying climatological mean and 90th percentile threshold are calculated for each day of the year using the pool of daily temperature values across all years within an 11-day window centred on the day, which are then smoothed using a 31-day moving window. The use of a seasonally-varying threshold allows for the detection of summer heatwaves as well as winter warm spells.&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p class=&amp;quot;p2&amp;quot;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p class=&amp;quot;p1&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;s1&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Marine heatwaves detected using this definition are assigned a set of properties. These properties include duration, several measures of intensity, and onset and decline rates.  These metrics are defined as follows: &amp;quot;duration&amp;quot; is the time between the event's start and end dates, &amp;quot;mean intensity&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;maximum intensity&amp;quot; are the average and maximum temperature anomaly (measured relative to the climatological, seasonally-varying mean) over the duration of the event respectively, &amp;quot;cumulative intensity&amp;quot; is the integrated temperature anomaly over the duration of the event, and  &amp;quot;onset rate&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;decline rate&amp;quot; are the rates of temperature increase and decline from the start date to the peak of the event and from the peak to the end date respectively.  In addition, annual time series are calculated for each MHW property. For duration, the intensity metrics, and depth this is the average of these properties across all events in each year; years with no events are marked as missing data. We also calculate frequency, being the count of events in each year, and total MHW days, being the sum of the durations of all events in each year.&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

            <description type="lineage">The WOfS product is a key component of the National Flood Risk Information Portal (NFRIP), developed by GA. The objective of Water Observations from Space is to analyse GA's historic archive of satellite imagery to derive water observations, to help understand where flooding may have occurred in the past. The collection of many hundred thousand WOFLs that make up WOfS are too cumbersome to display easily. WO_STATS provides the mechanism to present and deliver WOfS in a more easily digestible form, and provides understanding of water in the landscape. WO-FILT-STATS provides extra information to give a confidence in whether water is likely in the locations shown by the other WOfS products and provides a final, "cleaned" summary of water over time.

WO-FILT-STATS is created from the WOfS-STATS statistics (WO-STATS_25_2.1.5) derived from water classification (WO_25_2.1.5).

Reviews of prototype products identified the need to indicate the level of confidence for the surface water observations. The confidence level will help the user to distinguish between unusual but valid water detections (such as flood plains which might only be observed as water once in the 15 year interval) and ‘false positives’ which can be caused, for instance, by steep shady slopes. The confidence level was determined through a multiple logistic regression of water observations against several factors that would either support or contradict the finding of water being present at the site. The factors comprise:

MrVBF, a multi-resolution valley bottom flatness product (Gallant et al., 2012) derived from Shuttle RADAR Topographic Mission (SRTM) data as part of the Terrestrial Ecosystems Research Network (TERN). Surface water pixels identified in valley bottoms were more likely to be positively detected.

Slope derived from SRTM Digital Surface Models. Water pixels on a slope were considered less plausible than those on a flat surface.

MODIS Open Water Likelihood (OWL) (Ticehurst et al, 2010) provides a plausibility based an independent water detection algorithm employing the MODIS sensor. If both detection algorithms agree on the presence of a surface water pixel, there is a greater plausibility that the detection is correct.

Observation Frequency (P), the number of observations of water as a fraction of the number of clear observations of the target pixel. P is high for more permanent water bodies.

Built-Up areas indicating areas of dense urban development. In such areas the water detection algorithm struggles to cope with the deep shadows cast by multi-story buildings and the generally noisy spectral response created by structures. The Built-Up layer is derived from the Ausralian Bureau of Statistics ASGS 2011 dataset, for urban centres of populations of 100 000 and over.

Once calculated the Confidence is used to filter the Water Summary from WO-STATS where confidence is &amp;lt;10% to create the Filtered Water Summary.</description>

            <description type="brief">In previous versions of WOfS, the basic water classifications, statistical summaries and confidence products were contained within one product with several datasets. As of version 2.1.5, WOfS is split into three products: Water Observation Feature Layers (WO_25_2.1.5), Summary Statistics (WO-STATS_25_2.1.5), and Filtered Summary Statistics (WO-FILT-STATS_25_2.1.5).

This product is Water Observations from Space - Filtered Statistics (WO-FILT-STATS), consisting of a Confidence layer that compares the WO-STATS water summary to other national water datasets, and the Filtered Water Summary which uses the Confidence to mask areas of the WO-STATS water summary where Confidence is low. The Filtered Water Summary provides the long term understanding of the recurrence of water in the landscape, with much of the noise due to misclassification filtered out. 

WO-FILT-STATS consists of the following datasets:

Confidence: the degree of agreement between water shown in the Water Summary and other national datasets. The Confidence layer provides understanding of whether the water shown in the Water Summary agrees with where water should exist in the landscape, such as due to sloping land or whether water has been detected in a location by other means.  
Filtered Water Summary: A simplified version of the Water Summary, showing the frequency of water observations where the Confidence is above a cutoff level. This layer gives a noise-reduced view of surface water across Australia.
Even though confidence filtering is applied to the Filtered Water Summary, some cloud and shadow, and sensor noise does persist.</description>

            <description type="lineage">Note: no video file exists for one of the mistaken cape transects.

Sampling took place at 13 regions along the east coast of Tasmania, each comprising 3 subsites - this dataset refers to one region - Maria Island, and the three subsites: Beaching, Bunker and Mistaken Cape. At each subsite two video transects were conducted perpendicular to the shore and two transects were conducted parallel with the shore. The perpendicular transects covered depths from 1 to 45 m, while parallel transects were within a depth range of 15 to 20 m. In most cases, perpendicular tows spanned the width of reef from the shore to the reef fringe/sand edge.  Parallel tows were conducted for 20-30 minutes or approximately 1 km in length (straight-line distance from tow start point), but tow speed varied depending on weather conditions and reef topography. Thus, at each site, ca. 6-7 km of inshore rocky reef was surveyed for barren habitat using this method, with the entire survey covering &amp;gt; 80 km of reef.

Substrate and habitat type were recorded using video analysis, with 4 categories of urchin barren habitat recognised (see below for definitions). Substratum types were resolved as either "unclassified reef" if the substratum type was unclear (usually where macroalgal cover prevented a clear view of the substratum) or, where the substratum could be discerned, "flat rock" with little apparent relief, "boulder reef", "cobble", "gravel", "pebble", or "sand". Habitat types denoted either C. rodgersii barrens, or habitat dominated by particular canopy-forming species. 
 
Habitat was classified as sea urchin barrens when the understorey was completely denuded, and the overstorey occupied &amp;lt;15% cover. We recognized four categories of sea urchin barrens habitat: Type 1 barrens denotes continuous barrens habitat in the camera field of view for &amp;gt; 10 m, while the other 3 categories are different types of "patchy" incipient barrens, where a patch was defined as a section of reef that was not continuously barren for 10 m. Type 2 barrens was defined as patchy barren where barrens covered &amp;gt; 40% of the bottom; Type 3 barrens defined patchy barrens in which barrens occupied between 20 - 40% cover; while Type 4 barrens referred to patchy barren where barren cover was &amp;lt; 20% cover.</description>
            <description type="lineage">The video camera system was a scaled down version of the system developed by Barker et al. (1999). The camera was mounted inside a positively buoyant protective cage with an attached chain to provide stability and ensure that the camera and frame floated 1-2 m above the sea floor. This system enabled towing the camera across rocky reef with rough topographic relief so that the camera remained a similar distance off the sea floor regardless of depth, providing a field of view ca. 3-4 m wide depending on surge and topography.  The camera system was linked to (1) an onboard video recorder to capture the image, date, time, position and depth; (2) a real time monitor; and (3) computer which logged the depth under the boat (from an electronic depth sounder) and position (from a GPS) of the vessel at 4 s intervals, and comments input by the operator.  Note that data on depth and position related to the boat, while the camera was on a tow line 40-55 m behind the boat.  In the laboratory, the video footage was examined in detail to classify habitat types, which was recorded against the logged data. In this way, the total distance of each video transect tow, and the proportion of each transect that was classified as C. rodgersii barrens and other habitat types was estimated from the logged GPS coordinates. In the event of poor GPS signals (e.g. at base of large cliffs), position was back-calculated by interpolating between fixes determined from good satellite coverage.

GPS used datum WGS84. Note GPS inaccuracy may have resulted if datum type unknowingly changed etc (e.g. some points may appear on land, however subsite names may also give an indication as to actual location).</description>
            <description type="lineage">Mistaken Cape 1: Video for both tows is extremely poor quality. In addition to poor light the digital tapes appear to be reused and seemed to have suffered. They are covered by moving diagonal interference lines and ?snow?. The CD-Rom images lack these interference patterns but are still very dark and grainy making analysis, particularly substrate identification difficult.

Parallel Tow: The notes indicate that the Genlock for this tow finishes at 6:30:51 but the data file still logged data points till 6:31:51. The video continues for a further 21.5 min past this point. But when Genlock is lost the video jumps. The image appears to be from another tow completely. (Light levels, better video quality, depth, presence of sand, different algal community all tend to indicate a major site/location shift. No such shift is recorded on the Notes sheet or appears in the latitude/longitude in the remaining extra minute of data. By inference we suspect this is an earlier tow video.) The last minute has been left on the file but there is no substrate or algal data with it only a note about the video stopping. This probably should be deleted before analysis (the extra minute).</description>

            <description type="full">The spatial extent of C. rodgersii "barrens" was estimated by surveying rocky reef habitat with a towed underwater video system.

            <description type="lineage">Note: no video file exists for one of the mistaken cape transects.

Sampling took place at 13 regions along the east coast of Tasmania, each comprising 3 subsites - this dataset refers to one region - Maria Island, and the three subsites: Beaching, Bunker and Mistaken Cape. At each subsite two video transects were conducted perpendicular to the shore and two transects were conducted parallel with the shore. The perpendicular transects covered depths from 1 to 45 m, while parallel transects were within a depth range of 15 to 20 m. In most cases, perpendicular tows spanned the width of reef from the shore to the reef fringe/sand edge.  Parallel tows were conducted for 20-30 minutes or approximately 1 km in length (straight-line distance from tow start point), but tow speed varied depending on weather conditions and reef topography. Thus, at each site, ca. 6-7 km of inshore rocky reef was surveyed for barren habitat using this method, with the entire survey covering &amp;gt; 80 km of reef.

Substrate and habitat type were recorded using video analysis, with 4 categories of urchin barren habitat recognised (see below for definitions). Substratum types were resolved as either "unclassified reef" if the substratum type was unclear (usually where macroalgal cover prevented a clear view of the substratum) or, where the substratum could be discerned, "flat rock" with little apparent relief, "boulder reef", "cobble", "gravel", "pebble", or "sand". Habitat types denoted either C. rodgersii barrens, or habitat dominated by particular canopy-forming species. 
 
Habitat was classified as sea urchin barrens when the understorey was completely denuded, and the overstorey occupied &amp;lt;15% cover. We recognized four categories of sea urchin barrens habitat: Type 1 barrens denotes continuous barrens habitat in the camera field of view for &amp;gt; 10 m, while the other 3 categories are different types of "patchy" incipient barrens, where a patch was defined as a section of reef that was not continuously barren for 10 m. Type 2 barrens was defined as patchy barren where barrens covered &amp;gt; 40% of the bottom; Type 3 barrens defined patchy barrens in which barrens occupied between 20 - 40% cover; while Type 4 barrens referred to patchy barren where barren cover was &amp;lt; 20% cover.</description>
            <description type="lineage">The video camera system was a scaled down version of the system developed by Barker et al. (1999). The camera was mounted inside a positively buoyant protective cage with an attached chain to provide stability and ensure that the camera and frame floated 1-2 m above the sea floor. This system enabled towing the camera across rocky reef with rough topographic relief so that the camera remained a similar distance off the sea floor regardless of depth, providing a field of view ca. 3-4 m wide depending on surge and topography.  The camera system was linked to (1) an onboard video recorder to capture the image, date, time, position and depth; (2) a real time monitor; and (3) computer which logged the depth under the boat (from an electronic depth sounder) and position (from a GPS) of the vessel at 4 s intervals, and comments input by the operator.  Note that data on depth and position related to the boat, while the camera was on a tow line 40-55 m behind the boat.  In the laboratory, the video footage was examined in detail to classify habitat types, which was recorded against the logged data. In this way, the total distance of each video transect tow, and the proportion of each transect that was classified as C. rodgersii barrens and other habitat types was estimated from the logged GPS coordinates. In the event of poor GPS signals (e.g. at base of large cliffs), position was back-calculated by interpolating between fixes determined from good satellite coverage.

GPS used datum WGS84. Note GPS inaccuracy may have resulted if datum type unknowingly changed etc (e.g. some points may appear on land, however subsite names may also give an indication as to actual location).</description>
            <description type="lineage">Mistaken Cape 1: Video for both tows is extremely poor quality. In addition to poor light the digital tapes appear to be reused and seemed to have suffered. They are covered by moving diagonal interference lines and ?snow?. The CD-Rom images lack these interference patterns but are still very dark and grainy making analysis, particularly substrate identification difficult.

Parallel Tow: The notes indicate that the Genlock for this tow finishes at 6:30:51 but the data file still logged data points till 6:31:51. The video continues for a further 21.5 min past this point. But when Genlock is lost the video jumps. The image appears to be from another tow completely. (Light levels, better video quality, depth, presence of sand, different algal community all tend to indicate a major site/location shift. No such shift is recorded on the Notes sheet or appears in the latitude/longitude in the remaining extra minute of data. By inference we suspect this is an earlier tow video.) The last minute has been left on the file but there is no substrate or algal data with it only a note about the video stopping. This probably should be deleted before analysis (the extra minute).</description>

            <description type="brief">Overview  
 The March edition of Agricultural commodities contains ABARES' latest outlook for Australia's key agricultural commodities to 2021-22. 
 The outlook will be an important focal point at the conference and underpin many presentations delivered by ABARES speakers at the conference. 
 The report provides updated commodity forecasts, as well as articles on the EU sheep meat industry; farm performance of broadacre and dairy farms; productivity in Australia's broadacre and dairy industries; and disaggregating farm performance by size. 

Key Issues 
 Commodity forecasts  
• The gross value of farm production is forecast to increase by 8.3 per cent to a record $63.8 billion in 2016-17 before easing by 3.9 per cent to a forecast $61.3 billion in 2017-18. Despite the forecast decline, the gross value of farm production in 2017-18 would be 17.3 per cent higher than the average of $52.3 billion over the five years to 2015-16 in nominal terms. 
• The gross value of livestock production is forecast to increase by around 4.4 per cent to $31.2 billion in 2017-18, following a forecast decrease of 2.6 per cent in 2016-17. If this forecast is realised, the gross value of livestock production in 2017-18 would be around 28 per cent higher than the average of $24.4 billion over the five years to 2015-16 in nominal terms. 
• The gross value of crop production is forecast to decrease by 11.3 per cent to $30 billion in 2017-18, after a forecast increase of 20.2 per cent in 2016-17. The decrease follows record production of wheat and barley in 2016-17, which resulted from favourable seasonal conditions during winter and spring. If this forecast is realised, the gross value of crop production in 2017-18 would be around 8 per cent higher than the average of $27.9 billion over the five years to 2015-16 in nominal terms. 
• In 2021-22 the gross value of farm production is projected to be around $59.6 billion (in 2016-17 dollars), 8.6 per cent higher than the average of $54.9 billion over the five years to 2015-16 (also in 2016-17 dollars). In 2021-22 the gross value of crop production is projected to be around $29.0 billion and the gross value of livestock production is projected to be around $30.6 billion (in 2016-17 dollars). 
• Export earnings from farm commodities are forecast to be around $48.7 billion in 2017-18, higher than the forecast $47.7 billion in 2016-17. 
• The agricultural commodities for which export earnings are forecast to rise in 2017-18 are beef and veal (up 1 per cent), wool (10 per cent), dairy products (11 per cent), sugar (10 per cent), cotton (35 per cent), wine (5 per cent), lamb (3 per cent), live feeder/slaughter cattle (4 per cent), rock lobster (6 per cent) and mutton (1 per cent). 
• Forecast increases in 2017-18 are expected to be partly offset by expected declines in export earnings for wheat (down 9 per cent), coarse grains (11 per cent), canola (6 per cent) and chickpeas (42 per cent). 
• In Australian dollar terms, export prices of wool, dairy products, sugar, wine, lamb, barley, canola, rock lobster and mutton are forecast to increase in 2017-18. Export prices for cotton and chickpeas are forecast to fall. Prices for beef and veal, wheat and live feeder/slaughter cattle are forecast to remain around the same as in 2016-17. 
• In 2021-22 the value of farm exports is projected to be around $46.6 billion (in 2016-17 dollars), 8 per cent higher than the average of $43.1 billion over the five years to 2015-16 in real terms. 
• The value of crop exports is projected to be $24.9 billion (in 2016-17 dollars) in 2021-22, 7 per cent higher than the average of $23.2 billion over the five years to 2015-16 in real terms. The value of livestock exports is projected to be $21.8 billion (in 2016-17 dollars) in 2021-22, 10 per cent higher than the average of $19.8 billion over the five years to 2015-16 in real terms. 
• Export earnings for fisheries products are forecast to increase by 2.3 per cent in 2017-18 to $1.5 billion, after decreasing by a forecast 3.4 per cent in 2016-17. 

 Economic assumptions underlying this set of commodity forecasts  

 In preparing this set of agricultural commodity forecasts: • World economic growth is assumed to be 3.3 per cent in 2017 and 3.4 per cent in 2018. Growth is expected to rise further to around 3.5 per cent in 2019 before declining to 3.4 per cent in 2021 and 3.3 per cent in 2022. 
• Economic growth in Australia is assumed to average 2.8 per cent in 2017-18. Over the medium term to 2021-22, economic growth is assumed to average around 3 per cent. 
• The Australian dollar is assumed to average US73 cents in 2017-18, slightly lower than the forecast average of US75 cents in 2016-17. It is assumed to appreciate slightly over the medium term, reaching US74 cents towards 2021-22. 

 Articles on agricultural issues  
 The EU sheep meat industry  
• The European Union is one of the world's largest consumers of sheep meat. Imports are controlled by import quotas and prohibitive out-of-quota tariffs. 
• Australia is the second largest exporter to the European Union, behind New Zealand, although its allocated quota is just 8 per cent that of New Zealand's. 
• As a high value market for sheep meat, expanding sheep meat exports to the European Union would benefit the Australian industry. However, until the trade outcomes of Brexit are known, opportunities for Australian sheep meat exporters are uncertain. 

 Farm performance: broadacre and dairy farms, 2014-15 to 2016-17  
• In 2016-17 farm cash income for Australian broadacre farms is projected to average $216,000 a farm, the highest recorded in the past 20 years. 
• Record broadacre farm cash incomes this year are the result of near record winter grain production in most regions and good prices for beef cattle, sheep, lamb and wool. 
• Average farm cash income is projected to increase for broadacre farms in all states except Tasmania in 2016-17. 
• Farm cash income for dairy farms is projected to decline by 17 per cent nationally to an average of $105,000 a farm in 2016-17, reflecting lower average farmgate milk prices and reduced milk production. 

 Productivity in Australia's broadacre and dairy industries  
• From 1977-78 to 2014-15, productivity in the broadacre industries averaged 1.1 per cent a year as a result of declining input use (down 1 per cent a year) and modest output growth (up 0.1 per cent a year). 
• In the dairy industry, productivity growth averaged 1.5 per cent a year between 1978-79 and 2014-15. This reflected average annual growth of 1.3 per cent in output and an average annual decline of 0.2 per cent in input use. 

 Disaggregating farm performance by size  
• The largest 10 per cent of broadacre farms produced 46 per cent of total output, while the smallest 50 per cent of farms produced 12 per cent of total output. 
• The average rate of return, including capital appreciation, generated by the largest 10 per cent of broadacre farms was 8.2 per cent, while the smallest 10 per cent generated average returns of -2.8 per cent. 
• The largest 10 per cent of broadacre farms had the lowest average equity ratio of all farms (79 per cent), while the smallest 10 per cent of farms had the highest average equity ratio (97 per cent).

            <description type="full">This is an artificially created series. The volumes have been brought together as a collection of administrative registers which were used by the administration unit within the Department of Community Services Victoria for the purpose of recording details relating to enquiries regarding adoption, applications and arrangements for individual adoption cases, and details of finalised adoption cases. &amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;The collection of registers includes:&amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;- Ward / Non-Ward Cases Finalised Adoptions&amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt; - Protestant Register of Adoption Applications&amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;- Adoption Enquiries    &amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;- Placement Meetings &amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt; - Ward Dispensations Register&amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;- Legalizations referred by PCU [Permanent Care Unit]  &amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;The registers were later used by the Adoption Information Service as a reference resource for assisting individuals enquiring about past adoptions. &amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;The Adoption Information Service (AIS) was established by the Department in 1985 to assist people who had been separated by adoption, and who wanted to receive information or contact each other.  The AIS provided a service whereby individuals could place their name on an information register, to obtain information and to make contact. The service also offered counselling and intermediary services. The Adoption Information Service Unit later became the Family Information Network Discovery service, which continues to provide similar services to individuals affected by adoption and out of home care.&amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;Volume 1:  Ward and Non-Ward Cases Finalised Register&amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;Although the title of the register suggests that the register was maintained to record finalised cases, it has not been determined when the details were entered and, therefore, what the exact function of the register was. There does not appear to be any recognised pattern of entry in the volume, particularly in the various aspects usually documented in the management of adoption cases: by date of placement, case lodgement at court, date of birth, court order, court hearing or costs received. There is no known index to the volume. Entries are numbered from 1 through to 1070, with a date range of 1969 to 1972. &amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;The register usually includes a register entry number, child and applicant&amp;#039;s names, applicant address, dates on which costs were received, affidavits, sworn, the court hearing, and the date on which the adoption order was granted.  &amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;Information recorded includes: ward number or file number (eg: 68/83 file number or 87575 ward number), child&amp;#039;s name, surname and residence of person applying to adopt the child, applicant&amp;#039;s surname, date of receipt of court costs and date of lodging of application at court, place and date of hearing and date of granting of adoption order, name of judge granting the order.&amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;Volume 2:  Protestant Register of Adoption Applicants&amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;The volume is a register of applicants who have applied to adopt a child / children, who have been identified as being of the Protestant faith. There is an alphabetical index to entries at the front of the volume, arranged by surname of the applicant. The applicant numbers range between 25001 and 26240, dating from January 1952 through to July 1963. It is not clear why the applicant numbers commence at 25001. It is possible that the sequence of applicant numbers began at random, and does not necessarily reflect the actual number of adoption applicants.&amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;The register includes an applicant entry number, applicant&amp;#039;s name and address, family (age and sex of natural children of the applicant), religion (Church of England, Presbyterian, Methodist), preferred age and sex of child applied for, the name, sex and age of the child / children selected, date offered, date placed, and remarks (eg: home satisfactory, not recommended, child returned).&amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;Occasionally, application was made for a specific child, eg: a niece, grandchildren, or a child already in the care of the applicants.&amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;It appears to have been a practice of the Department to send a certain number of children to Protestant families and corresponding numbers to Catholic families. There are references to a register for Catholic applicants within this register, but the location of this register is not known.&amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;Volume 3:  Adoption Enquiries &amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;This volume records all applications received by the Adoption section in December 1975. Given that such a large number of enquiries were received in one month, it is believed that there may have been a media campaign at this time. Entries start at number 101 and continue through to number 1468. Entries are arranged by date of receipt of enquiry, from 3/12/1975 to 14/1/1976. &amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;The register has an internal alphabetical index at the front of the volume, which provides reference to the entry number within the volume. &amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;The contents include an entry number, applicant name and address, dates of receipt of application, date of acknowledgement, whether the enquiry was received by letter or phone, by whom acknowledgement was given (ie: initials of the officer responding to the enquiry), notes regarding the action taken (eg: proceed, refer file no. , withdrawn, rejected, hold-Mrs Pregnant) and initials of the social worker dealing with the case).&amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;Volume 4: Placement Meetings &amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;The Register was maintained by the Adoption and Permanent Care Unit administration staff of the Department of Community Welfare Services, to document weekly placement meetings, recording the initial linking and matching of children requiring out of home care, and applications from care providers. &amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt; &amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;The volume includes Placement Meetings from 12 May 1975 through to 4 March 1982. &amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;Pages are titled: &amp;#039;Placement Meeting&amp;#039;, together with the meeting date. &amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;The information recorded for each meeting varies over time, but can include: the file number of the ward or non-ward (eg: 92472) or the case file number (eg: 76/112), the child&amp;#039;s name, date of opening of case, applicants&amp;#039; surname, applicant&amp;#039;s residence (suburb or locality), name of social worker, and action required (eg: proceed to introduction, liaise further, suggest child, and if suitable to process, tentative link). Some placement meetings were held with other agencies, to link children and adoptive applicants. &amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;The binding is loose on this volume.&amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;Volume 5:  Dispensations and Consents Granted Registers:&amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;Two registers maintained by the Adoption and Permanent Care Unit within the Department of Community Welfare Services and predecessor agencies, with a date range of 1966 to 1987. Applications could be made to court to dispense with the need for the natural parents&amp;#039; consent prior to a child&amp;#039;s adoption. Dispensation could be granted in cases where the natural parent could not be located, where the parent was not in a fit mental or physical state to consider the issue of adoption, or where the parent had previously neglected or ill-treated the child. &amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;The contents may include: child&amp;#039;s name and date of birth, file number, date application lodged, on what grounds dispensation was sought, whose consent was dispensed with, date of legislation, From 1970, the location of the child was also noted (eg: Allambie, Berry Street, Royal Women&amp;#039;s Hospital, The Haven, Hartnett House).&amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;The first volume contains information regarding dispensation applications and outcome. This volume has also been used in reverse with entries commencing from the back page. The information recorded in the sequence at the reverse of the register includes the number of consents given in dispensation cases, the number of dispensations granted, case planning meetings attended by social workers, adoption case planning meetings for cases which did not proceed for a variety of reasons. &amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;Volume 5 (1): &amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;Title handwritten on the front cover listing contents of volume: &amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;&amp;#039;Consents to Adoption - taken.

&amp;lt;p class=&amp;quot;p1&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;s1&amp;quot;&amp;gt;During the experiment meltwater was added into the North Atlantic to simulate a weakening of NADW during H1.&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p class=&amp;quot;p1&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;s1&amp;quot;&amp;gt;4 experiments were performed=&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p class=&amp;quot;p1&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;s1&amp;quot;&amp;gt;LH1= freshwater addition in the Southern Ocean and weak southern hemispheric westerlies&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p class=&amp;quot;p1&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;s1&amp;quot;&amp;gt;LH1SO= salt addition in the Southern Ocean, weak southern hemispheric westerlies&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p class=&amp;quot;p1&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;s1&amp;quot;&amp;gt;LH1SHW= freshwater addition in the Southern Ocean, stronger southern hemispheric westerlies&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p class=&amp;quot;p1&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;s1&amp;quot;&amp;gt;LH1SOSHW= salt addition in the Southern Ocean, stronger southern hemispheric westerlies&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p class=&amp;quot;p1&amp;quot;&amp;gt;The dataset include AABW and NPIW strength, atmospheric CO2, d13C and D14C as well as oceanic DIC and d13C values for a subset of experiments. d13C and D14C values are the isotopic signatures of oceanic DIC and respectively represent a measure of the ratio of stable isotopes  13C  and radioactive isotope 14C with respect to the standard . Both are reported in parts per thousand. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p class=&amp;quot;p1&amp;quot;&amp;gt;LOVECLIM is an acronym made from the names of the five different models that have been coupled to built the Earth system model: LOch-Vecode-Ecbilt-CLio-agIsm Model (LOVECLIM). LOVECLIM 1.2 includes representations of the atmosphere, the ocean and sea ice, the land surface (including vegetation), the ice sheets, the icebergs and the carbon cycle. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p class=&amp;quot;p1&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;s1&amp;quot;&amp;gt;The atmospheric component is ECBilt2, a T21, 3-level quasi-geostrophic model. The oceanic component is CLIO3, which is made up of an ocean general circulation model coupled to a comprehensive thermodynamic-dynamic sea-ice model. Its horizontal resolution is 3° by 3°, and there are 20 levels in the ocean. ECBilt-CLIO is coupled to VECODE, a vegetation model that simulates &amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;s1&amp;quot;&amp;gt;the dynamics of two main terrestrial plant functional types, trees and grasses, as well as desert. VECODE also simulates the evolution of the carbon cycle over land while the oceanic ca&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;rbon cycle is represented in LOCH, a comprehensive model that takes into account both the solubility and biological pumps.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p class=&amp;quot;p3&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;s2&amp;quot;&amp;gt;LOVECLIM description is an extract from &amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;s3&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://www.academia.edu/12279222/Description_of_the_Earth_system_model_of_intermediate_complexity_LOVECLIM_version_1.2&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot;&amp;gt;http://www.academia.edu/12279222/Description_of_the_Earth_system_model_of_intermediate_complexity_LOVECLIM_version_1.2&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p class=&amp;quot;p3&amp;quot;&amp;gt;The experiments performed with MOM5-SIS-WOMBAT include a control run and a simulation with poleward intensified southern hemisphere westerlies.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p class=&amp;quot;p1&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;s1&amp;quot;&amp;gt;The outputs from these simulations include dissolved inorganic carbon and CO2 flux out of the ocean. &amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

            <description type="full">&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The data included in this repository includes both the physical and biogeochemical fields that were generated by 36 simulations over 10,000 years with an Ocean General Circulation Model (GCM): CSIRO Mk3L v1.2. The 36 simulations represent a factorial experimental set-up, where 6 different parameterisations of ocean biology were broadcast across six different physical states.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The aim of these experiments was to test if new insights into how the cycling of organic matter in the ocean functions can offer some benefit to climate models. But to be sure that a particular process is important to global ocean biogeochemistry (i.e carbon storage), we needed to make these tests across a range of different circulations and physical states.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;All physical states were of Pre-Industrial (PI; 1850 CE) climate. They were generated by forcing the Ocean GCM with the boundary conditions produced by piControl runs of CSIRO Mk3L v1.2, GFDL-ESM2G, IPSL-CM5A-MR, HadGEM2-CC, MPI-ESM-MR and MRI-CGCM3. These boundary conditions were sea surface temperature, salinity and the meridional and zonal components of surface wind stresses, and the final 10 years of these runs were averaged and regridded onto the CSIRO Mk3L v1.2 grid space. Therefore, six unique physical ocean states were generated.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Six unique biological states were also generated by implementing different biological parameterisations within the biogeochemical model code. These included variable nutrient dependence for phytoplankton growth (Smith et al., 2009), variable remineralisation profiles with depth that were dependent on temperature (Marsay et al., 2015) or community composition (Weber et al., 2016), and a variable stoichiometry of organic matter based on nutrient concentrations (Galbratih and Martiny, 2015). These four different and already published parameterisations were implemented into the biogeochemical code individually, and once in combination (excluding the temperature-dependent remineralisation), to create five new biogeochemical models. Hence, six unique biological states were created, including the basic, unaltered biogeochemical model.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Climatologies of sea surface temperature, sea surface salinity, and x and y vectors of sea surface wind stresses were produced by both the PI and LGM coupled experiments and were used to force the ocean general circulation model. Additional climatologies of sea ice fractional cover, sea surface wind speeds, net incident short-wave radiation, and the aeolian deposition of iron and reactive nitrogen were important for forcing the biogeochemical model. These climatologies are made available here.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Also available are the three-dimensional global annual averages of oceanic properties for all 36 simulations at their steady-state solutions. These include temperature, salinity, oxygen, apparent oxygen utilisation, dissolved inorganic carbon, alkalinity, phosphate, nitrate and iron concentrations.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

            <description type="full">VPRS 8770/P1: Geelong &amp; Ballaarat Railway.  Tender Forms (c.1871-c.1890).&amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;Six boxes of records were found bearing the number &amp;quot;420&amp;quot; and numbered 1 to 6.  The style of the &amp;quot;420&amp;quot; on the last box was different to the preceding five boxes.  This may indicate that the last box does not belong with the other 5.  Material in the first five boxes was originally accessioned and described as RCB 11 (converted to VPRS 420).  The series register shows that the sixth unit was added later. &amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;This unit, sometime-unit 6 of VPRS 420, comprises tender forms with no apparent date for the Geelong and Ballaarat Railway.

From stamps on the covers of the reports, it is evident that these records were at one time part of the collection in the Commissioners Library. The reports were all produced by Victorian Railways, on a variety of subjects, dating from c.1904 to c.1926. See the Records Description List for VPRS 8770/P3 for more information.&amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;VPRS 8770/P4    Reports (Engineer In Chiefs Branch)&amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;The records in VPRS 8770/P4 consist of various reports, memoranda, correspondence and other documents which appear to have been accumulated and maintained as a collection by an office within the Victorian Railways (most likely the Engineer-in-Chiefs branch). These reports relate to a number of different subjects and cover a wide date range, but broadly relate to the construction of new lines of railway in Victoria.&amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;BR /&amp;gt;Some documents in Unit 2 of VPRS 8770.P4 do not relate to the function of construction of railways. Many of these documents relate to other functions of the Board of Land and Works (which was responsible for railways between 1857-1883), such as provision of water supply (the Board assumed responsibility for this in 1859). It is possible that copies of various reports and contracts were forwarded to the Engineer-in-Chief as reference copies.

            <description type="brief">This project will act as an integrating focus within the rainforest theme to strategically target research gaps and thereby increase our understanding of the drivers of rainforest biodiversity. We will generate high resolution maps and landscape scale estimates of temporal trends in the condition of biodiversity and environmental changes. 

The project consists of four subprojects:

A. Monitoring: Tasks include a microsensor network, standardised vertebrate surveys, habitat structure monitoring and data harvesting from other projects. 

A comprehensive review of regional literature followed by extensive stakeholder consultation identified long-term monitoring data as the most important knowledge gap in the region (Welbergen et al. 2011). This sub-project is aimed at maintaining and significantly improving a regional-scale, long-term environmental monitoring program that provides biodiversity and environmental data that has a demonstrated value to a wide range of users including the research community, regional/state/national management agencies and conservation policy development, and national / international bioinformatic infrastructure initiatives (e.g. ALA, TERN). Data collected and maintained here will provide the primary input for the other sub-projects described below with flow-on inputs to many of the other proposed projects across the rainforest node. These data will include but not be limited to:
1. Regional microclimate sensor network at more than 30 sites established under MTSRF that are strategically placed across elevational and latitudinal gradients in the region.
o Replace and upgrade existing microclimate stations (now defunct/worn out)
o Establish standardised microclimate logging stations in new sites in gaps in environmental coverage, identified climatic refugia, peripheral habitat isolates and increased coverage of the rainforest edge habitats (e.g. wet sclerophyll). Data: temperature (air, soil, microhabitats), humidity, soil moisture, cloud interception.
2. Standardised vertebrate surveys across all long-term sites (&amp;gt;30) including:
o  2-4 complete surveys per year for three years with 6 replicated sampling points within each site and including standardised surveys of: birds, reptiles, spotlighting (mammals and other nocturnal fauna) and microhylid frogs, with potential to add specific other groups dependent on student projects. 
o These surveys follow well-established and extensively published methodologies within the CTBCC (e.g. Williams et al. Ecology 2010).  
3. Habitat structure monitoring will be continued and improved at all monitoring sites both directly by this project and via site-based collaboration with other projects including rainforest dynamics project (Project 10 - Laurance) and plant genetics (Project 9 -Crayn). 
4. Link to Project 14: potential monitoring of vegetation structure and thermal properties using UAV technology to capture aerial photos, multispectral remote sensing, Lidar vegetation structure, thermal imagery of habitat and fauna, cyclone damage and canopy condition.
5. Additional monitoring data will be harvested across the node for increased regional and taxonomic coverage and baseline data improvements via links and data exchange with Projects 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 15, 16, 18, 20 and 25. 


B. Climate change vulnerability and adaptation: Includes the production of downscaled regional climate projections, projected changes in species distribution models, composite biodiversity maps, identification and mapping of climate refugia, predictive models of impacts on biodiversity including extreme events. 

Climate change is arguably the single largest threat to biodiversity in Australia and the unique biodiversity of the Wet Tropics rainforests is recognised as one of the most threatened ecosystems globally (IPCC 4th AR). This subproject will build on previous and existing research to provide cutting-edge predictions on climate change impacts, vulnerability assessment and adaptation options for rainforest biodiversity. We will link closely with the National Climate Change Adaptation Research Network to ensure that outputs, tools and approaches are distributed across this network for maximum national and regional benefit and outcomes.  Specific objectives and collaborative links include:
1. Produce and make available downscaled regional climate projections using eight Global Climate Models across multiple (at least 3) emission scenarios at 10 year time steps from 1970-2080 for more than 50 bioclimatic variables;
2. Projected changes, including uncertainty estimates, in species distribution models and composite biodiversity maps for the majority of rainforest vertebrates, 500+ species of invertebrates, major vegetation types and some key ecosystem processes (baseline data for these analyses were collected under MTSRF and ongoing projects within the CTBCC);
3. Identify and map climatic refugia (extension of previous MTSRF work that mapped landscape-scale temperature refugia by Shoo et al. 2010a, 2010b). This analysis will expand previous work to include finer scale microhabitat refugia and also increase the generality of the analyses by examining moisture refugia and dry season drought events that have been shown to have significant impacts on biodiversity (Williams &amp; Middleton 2008, Middleton &amp; Williams in review). 
4. Produce predictive impact models on biodiversity that explicitely include a consideration of extreme events rather than just environmental means/averages. Project will link closely with the extreme climate events project (Project 16 ¿ Welbergen) to incorporate the impacts of changes in the frequency, intensity, duration and extent of extreme events, such as heat waves and droughts, as a major component of assessing relative vulnerability and adaptation actions; 
5. Project will closely collaborate with Project 15 (Phillips, Llewelyn) examining the potential for useful local adaptation to climate changeextremes in isolated populations. This link explores the potential to utilise existing adaptive potential as a means to increase species resilience to climate change.
6. Other external links:
¿ NCCARF Refugia project (National) -  proposed
¿ NCCARF Terrestrial Biodiversity Research Network
¿ Northern Biodiversity NERP Hub
¿ AEDA Hub ¿ Restoration project and Future Fellowship (Wintle) examining demographic modelling and climate change.
7. Incorporate IPCC 5th Assessment Report climate models and scenarios into all above analyses, once they become available.

C. Synthesis, analysis and integration: Determinants of biodiversity: Includes mapping of almost all rainforest vertebrates and 200+ species of invertebrates, identify key monitoring locations, examining the relationships between biodiversity and vegetation and landscape structure. 

An understanding of the drivers of biodiversity in the region is crucial to predicting impacts from a variety of threats and ensuring effective conservation planning and management that aims to maintain a resilient landscape. We will use data collected in subproject A in combination with our existing extensive vertebrate and invertebrate database to examine the drivers of biodiversity in the region and to provide the resources and knowledge to make this useful to stakeholders. Specific objectives will include, but not be limited to: 
1. Mapping of almost all rainforest vertebrates and &amp;gt;500 species of invertebrates (distribution and abundance) with emphasis on threatened species;
2. Identify key locations and taxa where we have long-term count data and/or high frequency of repeat count surveys over time periods that have encompassed important environmental change. We will undertake statistical power analyses to evaluate condition and trends of species (e.g., range shifts, change in population size);
3. Analyses will also inform the design of our ongoing monitoring program (subproject A) to maximise the detection of change in a cost-effective manner. 
4. Comprehensive habitat/vegetation type vulnerability assessment;
5. Examine a range of environmental and evolutionary drivers of biodiversity to provide the basic scientific underpinnings for evidence-based policy and management in the region including paleostability of habitat; seasonal habitat and climatic stability, relationships to ecosystem processes such as net primary productivity, habitat structure and heterogeneity, species and habitat compositional turnover and evolutionary biology.
6. Examine relationships between biodiversity and vegetation and landscape structure (vegetation type and structure, habitat extent, connectivity etc.)

D. Status, trends and future projections: Includes Producing a spatial and temporal resources tool that allows web-based query of all the above datasets.

No practical measure currently exists to evaluate trends in biodiversity values at the ¿whole-of-region¿ scale in near real-time on a regular, repeatable and affordable basis (WTMA Research Strategy 2010-2014). We will generate high resolution maps and landscape scale estimates of temporal trends in the condition of biodiversity and environmental changes. This will be the major vehicle for synthesizing, integrating and communicating data from all projects. This project will make use of extensive computing power represented by the collaboration between the CTBCC and the James Cook University eResearch group and High Performance Computing Facility. Specific objectives:
1. Produce and make publicly available a spatial and temporal resources tool that allows web-based query of all the above datasets based on a user-defined spatial area that will return all predicted and observed data within the query area for climate (past, current and future projections), habitat, species (predicted and observed), biodiversity values, terrain, ecosystem processes and, where available data is site-based, the tool could query the temporal patterns in the data (e.g. changes in abundance of a species) with ¿approaching real-time¿ updates (expected bi-annual upload of all new biodiversity and environmental data with temporal resolution dependent on the specific data stream, example quarterly for the standardised vertebrate surveys).
2. Automatic upload, synthesis and visualisation in JCU eResearch group (Tropical Data Hub) including time series examination of trends;
3. Automated upload via Tropical Data Hub onto National (ALA, TERN, NPEI) and international (GBIF) data infrastructure. This means that as data is entered into our system from the monitoring program and other projects, it will be uploaded and available via national and international data portals;
4. Future forecasting of trends and forecasts via combination of modelling and workshopping to conduct future horizon scanning.

Once established, these bioinformatic tools could form the basis for UNESCO, and Queensland and Australian government reporting on the state of the Wet Tropics World Heritage Area, and could easily be utilized more generally across other ecosystems in Australia.</description>

      Taken from the 2008-2009 Progress Report:
      Difficulties affecting project:
      We have had ongoing technical issue with the FRRF. The instrument has been returned to British manufacturer (Chelsea) for the past 2 years. The instrument was fully tested on board before departure but still developed technical problems shortly after leaving. With the help of an AAD technician, the instrument was able to fully operate. 
      
      Taken from the 2009-2010 Progress Report:
      Field work:
      We participated in V1 of the Aurora Australis in spring 2009. The focus of the work this season was collecting continuous primary production measurements using a fast repetition rate fluorometer (FRRF). We have developed a deck incubator system which allows us to measure surface primary production continuously. Previous applications of this equipment have either required CTD deployments for vertical primary production measurements or lab based measurements of photosynthetic stress.
      
      Seawater from 6 metres depth was continuously supplied to the FRRF incubator located on the helideck. The seawater was directed to FRRF measuring chamber where chlorophyll a fluorescence emitted by phytoplankton was measured every minute. Chlorophyll a concentration was determined by filtering 1 L of seawater through 47 mm diameter Whatman GF/F filters, which were immediately added with 10 ml of methanol and stored in 4 degree Celsius refrigerator for 8 to 24 hours. Samples were taken every 4 hours. Seawater was also collected and preserved in Lugol's iodine and brought back to University of Tasmania where species identification will be carried out. Measurement of phytoplankton parameters and chlorophyll a concentration were carried out on both south and northbound transects.
      
      Once a day the data from the FRRF was uploaded to computer and the lenses of the FRRF were cleaned.
      
      Laboratory activity/analysis:
      Chlorophyll determinations using a Turner 10AU Fluormeter and the acidification method oh Holm Hansen (1976) were completed on board. Phytoplankton species analysis using light microscopy and SEM is underway as part.</description>

            <description type="full">Sea ice covers up to 20 million km2 of the Southern Ocean.  When present it supports a vigorous ecosystem that provides energy and food for all other marine organisms.  Using the latest micro sensor technology, we are examining the factors that effect the productivity of this vital link in the Antarctic marine food web.

New data were added to this metadata record in January 2011.  These data included FRRF data collected on the CEAMARC, CASO, SIPEX and SAZ-SENSE voyages.  A word document in the download file provides details about these datasets, plus those collected on Voyage 1 2009-2010, and voyage 2 2008-2009.

The download file also contains a folder labelled "Older data".  This data is described below:

An explanation of the excel spreadsheet in the download file is as follows:

Worksheet 1 is the chlorophyll data
Worksheet 3 is the location data

CHLOROPHYLL DATA
Column A is sample name, the first letter refers to the location data in worksheet 3, the second to the ice flow number and the third to the replicate number Section refers to depth in ice core, measured from the bottom
Ignore C
Column D is the total volume of melted ice
Column E is the volume of D that was filtered
Column G is the Fluorometer reading before the addition dilute HCl
Column H is the fluorometer reading after the addition of acid
Column I is the calculation of chlorophyl concentration in the sample
Column K is areal chlorophyll estimate
Column L is the mean for the core
Column N is the mean for the site
Column O is the standard deviation

LOCATION DATA
Lat, longs and times of each sampling.  The first set (B-G) refers to the time sampling started, the second (H-M) to when it finished
  
Project objectives:
- Determine the net photosynthesis and primary productivity of the phytoplankton and major sea ice algal communities of the Eastern Antarctic Sea Ice Zone (SIZ). Estimate seasonal and annual algal production and inter annual variability

- Obtain data on biomass distribution and variability to establish regional relationships between ice thickness, snow cover, and biomass

- Determine the effects of

a) Light
b) Nutrients (principally nitrate and iron)
c) Temperature

on photosynthesis and primary production

- Determine whether the biomass and productivity of the phytoplankton and sea ice algae in winter and spring limits the biomass or growth of krill

- Estimate the effects of climate change on Sea ice Zone primary production

Taken from the 2008-2009 Progress Report:
Progress against objectives:
This project used V2, a spring voyage, to collect underway data to determine surface biomass and primary production. Biomass samples (chlorophyll a) were taken every 3 hours. Productivity estimates by PAM were also made every 3 hours. Productivity measurements by FRRF were made every 1 minute. Nutrient samples were taken at the same time as the biomass samples.
Analysis of the biomass samples is complete. Preliminary analysis of the productivity data has commenced. This data is being used for a Masters project (Rob Johnson, IASOS).
An iron addition experiment accompanied this monitoring. Iron was added to samples taken every 3 hours and the change in photosynthesis (maximum quantum yield) measured with a PAM. The rate of recovery from iron stress was the principal focus.
Most of this data has been submitted as metadata.
Using The PAM and FRRF simultaneously also enabled a comparison to be made between these different ways of measuring photosynthesis.

Progress was also made on the analysis of FRRF productivity and biomass data collected over several years on the L'Astrolabe transect. Analysis involves quantitative manipulation of FRRF data and correlation with chlorophyll, nutrients, temperature and other biological parameters. A publication arising from this work will be submitted this year. 

Taken from the 2009-2010 Progress Report:
Progress against objectives:
We participated in V1 of the Aurora Australis, spring 2009. The objective of this project was to measure surface primary production off East Antarctica. Photosynthetic parameters of phytoplankton under actinic light (L) as well as in darkness (D) were measured using a fast repetition rate fluorometer (FRRF). The parameters included the maximum photochemical efficiency (Fv/FmL,D), the functional absorption cross section of photosystem II (sPSII,L,D) and a turnover time of electron transfer (tL,D). Chlorophyll a concentration was measured by using Turner fluorometer. The photosynthetic parameters, irradiance and chlorophyll a concentration will then be used to estimate primary production of phytoplankton.

This field program particularly focussed on the first of the listed objectives, ie 'Determine the net photosynthesis and primary productivity of the phytoplankton and major sea ice algal communities of the Eastern Antarctic Sea Ice Zone (SIZ). Estimate seasonal and annual algal production and inter annual variability'. We have been collecting FRRF-based primary production data from each season and the 2009 data provides the late spring data to supplement data from autumn, winter and summer, collected in previous seasons. We have now built up a comprehensive assessment of season variability which will enable a reliable estimate of annual primary production. These analyses will also provide a detailed snap shot of primary production with which to compare future changes.

Preliminary analysis shows clear patterns of variation in Fv/Fm, a parameter that is particularly sensitive to low iron concentration. This data is shown on an accompanying diagram. Productivity analysis is still underway. Much of the work for this project forms part of the PhD project of Cheah Wee.Wee is expected to finish his PhD by December 2010 and it is anticipated that all data analysis for the project will have been completed and the finished manuscripts submitted for publication. He has already had one manuscript form this project accepted (Cheah et al, 2010).</description>

            <description type="full">Global fisheries landings supplied by a number of agencies (FAO/UN, CCAMLR, NAFO, ICES etc) are mapped to 30-min spatial cells based on the range/gradient of the reported taxon, the spatial access of the reporting country's fleets, and the original reporting area. This data is separated to industrial and non-industrial fishing and associated with types of fishing gears. Estimates of illegal, unreported and unallocated landings are included as are estimates of the weight of fisheries products discarded at sea. For appropriate records, spatial information from tuna regional management organisations and satellite-based vessel Automatic Identification System (AIS) were used to allow greater precision. Mapping the source of fisheries capture allows investigation of the impacts of fishing and the vulnerability of fishing (with its associate food security implications) to climate change impacts. This is the most current version of the Global Fisheries Landings dataset.</description>
            <description type="lineage">1.1 Data sources, scope and overview

Input data was sourced from publicly available websites (Table 1.). All sources but the tuna regional management organization's (tuna rFMO) data and Global Fishing Watch's (GFW) vessel Automatic Identification System (AIS)-based data[1] were used initially in a similar fashion to [2] and summarised below to map reported landings to candidate 30-min spatial cells with a global grid (Supplementary Fig. 1). This included a separation of deemed industrial from non-industrial reported landings. Following this there was reevaluation and filtering of reported landings initially assigned to candidate spatial cells through the use of distributional information related to the associated fishing gear used, and where applicable, the tuna rFMO and AIS positional data (Table 1.) Subsequently this map of reported landings was extended through estimates for reported, Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) catch and associated discards for both the industrial and non-industrial sectors. The global Human Development Index (HDI) [3]  was used to assist estimation of IUU associated with non-industrial fisheries, and served as a simple available proxy for reporting likelihood.

Only records of taxa with a marine origin were used - although some are found in other habitats. Where possible aquaculture production was excluded as were records describing shells, coral, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals.

1.2 Initial mapping

As described in [2], FAO data for the period 1950 to 2015 was combined and coded with a range of other input sources for reported fisheries landings (Table 1.). Overlapping records were removed, and only the most spatially specific data was retained. Mapping involved using all means to identify the most specific taxonomy of the reported landing datum because this established both the potential range of fished spatial cells but also a gradient based on the rough abundance of the fished taxa related to critical habitats, ocean depths etc. [4]. Within the statistical area reported in source databases, usually only a subset of spatial cells were accessible to the fishing fleets of the reporting country [5]. This is because most global catch is taken within the claimed exclusive economic zone (EEZ) waters of countries where the access of foreign fishing fleets is regulated and usually documented.  

1.3 Separation to industrial and non-industrial sectors

The separation of landings from industrial and non-industrial fishing was based on a number of factors. The first was whether the taxa had a clear association to fishing gear not typically used in non-industrial fishing such as with tuna purse seine operations. Additionally, for each country the division was further derived by the relative association of the taxon described as landing by the two fishing sectors during the period of fishing by published catch reconstructions [6]. In addition, where the fishing occurred was considered important to the likely association with a fishing sector. Non-industrial fishing is typically accepted to occur within 200 km of shore and within 50 m of depth [7]. Division to sectors is acknowledged to be an imperfect science without detailed and specific data such as from logbooks, surveys etc. which unfortunately are not available for a global treatment.

1.4 Estimation of IUU and associated discards

As in [2], estimates of IUU and associated discards were made for each record of reported landings. For the industrial sector records the current procedure was largely unchanged. The relative association of landings with a range of fishing gears was made based on the fishing country, the year of fishing and the fished taxa [8]. This allowed published data on rates of IUU and discarding to be used [9, 10] to guide estimation of the missing components so that catch, and not simply reported landings, could be estimated. 

For the non-industrial sector it was clear that in order to achieve the published catch rates [7], as well as the national estimates for this sector published as country reconstructions [6], that the unreported component (IUU) of non-industrial fishing was significant. It was decided that the level of non-reporting in this sector to FAO and other parties was influenced by the national resources available for government monitoring. Therefore, the estimation of IUU for this sector was adjusted by country HDI [3], with poorer countries having relatively a larger portion of unreported landings. This expected association was verified by examining the breakdowns within country reconstructions [6] where we found a significant relationship with R2 = 0.29.


1.5 Adjustment for associated fishing gear logistics

As described in [2, 8] it possible to associate each fishing record with a range of fishing gears using the fishing year, country and the fished taxon. Each fishing gear was deemed to have a general global pattern of probable spatial distribution largely based on distance offshore, depth of water and the distributions of target taxa as summarised from previous mapping of catch and fishing effort [2, 11]. For non-industrial fishing, a single distribution was considered, which favoured the published association with nearshore and shallow areas [7].

The fishing gear logistics distribution was used to filter and redistribute catch associated with spatial cells in earlier processing. This further processing would, for example, rule out sites far off shore for non-industrial fishing by proportionately increasing landings associated with nearshore candidate cells.  The purpose was to enforce some rational and realistic consideration of gear-based logistic cost/benefit constraints on mapped solutions which has been missing in previous mapped database versions [2, 6].

1.6 Adjustment for tuna fisheries

For tuna fisheries, there exits greater mapping challenges and opportunities than for most other fisheries which are largely inshore. Tuna fisheries encompass all tropical and sub-tropical seas but each year, depending on the oceanographic conditions and any fishing access agreements negotiated by roving fleets, the focus of fishing can be in vastly different areas within the broad range of the fished taxa. Data from FAO and other sources has always been instructive to focus catch mapping to specific locations, as is the data made available by tuna rFMOs (Table 1.). Annual distributions, often in 1-degree or 5-degree spatial areas were used to improve the redistribution of spatial mapping from initial processing for the appropriate tuna taxa and associated fishing gears. 

1.7 Adjustment using satellite data

Most recently it has been possible to track the movement of large vessels at sea from satellites. Though there are dedicated systems such as satellite vessel monitoring systems (VMS) used extensively in fisheries management, these data are not widely available nor do they cover most global fishing operations. Most recently the use of AIS positional vessel tracking has shown promise. With considerable processing, it has even been possible to determine not only if the vessel is a fishing vessel but even something about the associated fishing gears in used and possibly vessel size [1]. Unfortunately, the AIS coverage has only become good in 2016 and is still weak in some areas such as SE Asia due to many factors [12]. Where possible, however, especially for offshore fishing for tuna, these data can add another valuable source of information about fishing distributions. AIS data from 2016 was used to constrain the mapping of relevant catches for 2015 and, with reducing effect, for fishing years back to 2010. Before 2010 it was considered that recent AIS data could not improve mapping procedures.

1.8 Mapping historical data (pre-1950)

A number of data sources describe country fisheries landings, sometimes by taxa, as early as Roman times. In limited cases, reconstructions exist for some stocks such as Atlantic herring and cod for nearly 1000 years[13]. Here the sources described in Table 1 were used as the basis for extending mapped reported landings to 1869. The procedure used was similar to that described for more recent (post-1950) industrial fisheries (above). The spatial guide used was based on the same reporting country and fished taxon in 1950. If there was no such matching record then the time period used was generalised to any fishing in the 1950s. If this failed then the fished taxon was generalised to a broader taxonomic range. Using this method, it was possible to map all available historical records. 

1.9 Revision modifications from 2018 version

Over the past four months a new and revised release of the mapped global catch database (1950-2015) has been prepared. The mapped data was recreated from sources as previously described [16]. Thanks to users it was found that the 2018 previous version had not completely addressed spatial artefacts caused when national statistics were reported only in one of the major FAO statistical reporting area that comprise their national exclusive economic zone. This had left unexplained unfished areas in some years. This was addressed in the current revision where possible.

There was also revision to assumptions about the scale of unreported catch by ‘non-industrial’ fisheries which has changed totals and the ratio of industrial to non-industrial catch. The split relies on factors such as decadal/country (but see below), fished taxa and associated fishing gear. 

It was recognised that there must be a formal way of expressing the proportion of catch that a country reports that is from the non-industrial sector and a way of calculating how this changes annually. Although PhD candidate at the University of Tasmania, Yannick Rousseau has shown that this is a difficult problem – not the least because of the complexity and diversity of how fishing sectors are defined internationally, it is possible to make some progress. For example, it is possible to know the breakdown of country fleets annually by their power class (Rousseau PhD thesis) and this can be related to the gross tonnage (GT) of fishing vessels using the relationship published in the supplemental work (Appendix B Tonnage kilowatt conversions) of earlier global fishing effort data constructions [17]. This makes it possible to use the average power for each class to be converted to GT. This tonnage is a better representation of anticipated fishing power. According to Rousseau (in progress), the cut-off value for power classes with the closest match to most recognised definitions of ‘small-scale’ (here termed non-industrial) fishing would be his PO4 class. Therefore, the proportion for each country/year of that GT total versus all GT was used to calculate a 'GTSS4Factor' and used in calculations. It is, however, likely that all countries have some non-industrial fishing so rather than assuming a zero value where there was no data for this ratio – a nominal value of 0.05 was applied as a default. Thus, in addition to the fished taxa and it associated gear, this was used to split global catches to industrial and non-industrial. There were also minor revisions to the application of weighting based on gear-associated logistics on spatial cell candidates previously selected based on the range/distribution of fished taxa and fleet fishing access within statistical reporting areas.

As expected, totals in this revision were generally similar to the previous version, as were the associated spatial patterns. For most general purposes this revision does not require dependent analysis to be redone but the author should be consulted when in doubt.

            <description type="full">Global fisheries landings supplied by a number of agencies (FAO/UN, CCAMLR, NAFO, ICES etc) are mapped to 30-min spatial cells based on the range/gradient of the reported taxon, the spatial access of the reporting country's fleets, and the original reporting area. This data is separated to industrial and non-industrial fishing and associated with types of fishing gears. Estimates of illegal, unreported and unallocated landings are included as are estimates of the weight of fisheries products discarded at sea. For appropriate records, spatial information from tuna regional management organisations and satellite-based vessel Automatic Identification System (AIS) were used to allow greater precision. Mapping the source of fisheries capture allows investigation of the impacts of fishing and the vulnerability of fishing (with its associate food security implications) to climate change impacts. This is the most current version of the Global Fisheries Landings dataset.</description>
            <description type="lineage">1.1 Data sources, scope and overview

Input data was sourced from publicly available websites (Table 1.). All sources but the tuna regional management organization's (tuna rFMO) data and Global Fishing Watch's (GFW) vessel Automatic Identification System (AIS)-based data[1] were used initially in a similar fashion to [2] and summarised below to map reported landings to candidate 30-min spatial cells with a global grid (Supplementary Fig. 1). This included a separation of deemed industrial from non-industrial reported landings. Following this there was reevaluation and filtering of reported landings initially assigned to candidate spatial cells through the use of distributional information related to the associated fishing gear used, and where applicable, the tuna rFMO and AIS positional data (Table 1.) Subsequently this map of reported landings was extended through estimates for reported, Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) catch and associated discards for both the industrial and non-industrial sectors. The global Human Development Index (HDI) [3]  was used to assist estimation of IUU associated with non-industrial fisheries, and served as a simple available proxy for reporting likelihood.

Only records of taxa with a marine origin were used - although some are found in other habitats. Where possible aquaculture production was excluded as were records describing shells, coral, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals.

1.2 Initial mapping

As described in [2], FAO data for the period 1950 to 2015 was combined and coded with a range of other input sources for reported fisheries landings (Table 1.). Overlapping records were removed, and only the most spatially specific data was retained. Mapping involved using all means to identify the most specific taxonomy of the reported landing datum because this established both the potential range of fished spatial cells but also a gradient based on the rough abundance of the fished taxa related to critical habitats, ocean depths etc. [4]. Within the statistical area reported in source databases, usually only a subset of spatial cells were accessible to the fishing fleets of the reporting country [5]. This is because most global catch is taken within the claimed exclusive economic zone (EEZ) waters of countries where the access of foreign fishing fleets is regulated and usually documented.  

1.3 Separation to industrial and non-industrial sectors

The separation of landings from industrial and non-industrial fishing was based on a number of factors. The first was whether the taxa had a clear association to fishing gear not typically used in non-industrial fishing such as with tuna purse seine operations. Additionally, for each country the division was further derived by the relative association of the taxon described as landing by the two fishing sectors during the period of fishing by published catch reconstructions [6]. In addition, where the fishing occurred was considered important to the likely association with a fishing sector. Non-industrial fishing is typically accepted to occur within 200 km of shore and within 50 m of depth [7]. Division to sectors is acknowledged to be an imperfect science without detailed and specific data such as from logbooks, surveys etc. which unfortunately are not available for a global treatment.

1.4 Estimation of IUU and associated discards

As in [2], estimates of IUU and associated discards were made for each record of reported landings. For the industrial sector records the current procedure was largely unchanged. The relative association of landings with a range of fishing gears was made based on the fishing country, the year of fishing and the fished taxa [8]. This allowed published data on rates of IUU and discarding to be used [9, 10] to guide estimation of the missing components so that catch, and not simply reported landings, could be estimated. 

For the non-industrial sector it was clear that in order to achieve the published catch rates [7], as well as the national estimates for this sector published as country reconstructions [6], that the unreported component (IUU) of non-industrial fishing was significant. It was decided that the level of non-reporting in this sector to FAO and other parties was influenced by the national resources available for government monitoring. Therefore, the estimation of IUU for this sector was adjusted by country HDI [3], with poorer countries having relatively a larger portion of unreported landings. This expected association was verified by examining the breakdowns within country reconstructions [6] where we found a significant relationship with R2 = 0.29.


1.5 Adjustment for associated fishing gear logistics

As described in [2, 8] it possible to associate each fishing record with a range of fishing gears using the fishing year, country and the fished taxon. Each fishing gear was deemed to have a general global pattern of probable spatial distribution largely based on distance offshore, depth of water and the distributions of target taxa as summarised from previous mapping of catch and fishing effort [2, 11]. For non-industrial fishing, a single distribution was considered, which favoured the published association with nearshore and shallow areas [7].

The fishing gear logistics distribution was used to filter and redistribute catch associated with spatial cells in earlier processing. This further processing would, for example, rule out sites far off shore for non-industrial fishing by proportionately increasing landings associated with nearshore candidate cells.  The purpose was to enforce some rational and realistic consideration of gear-based logistic cost/benefit constraints on mapped solutions which has been missing in previous mapped database versions [2, 6].

1.6 Adjustment for tuna fisheries

For tuna fisheries, there exits greater mapping challenges and opportunities than for most other fisheries which are largely inshore. Tuna fisheries encompass all tropical and sub-tropical seas but each year, depending on the oceanographic conditions and any fishing access agreements negotiated by roving fleets, the focus of fishing can be in vastly different areas within the broad range of the fished taxa. Data from FAO and other sources has always been instructive to focus catch mapping to specific locations, as is the data made available by tuna rFMOs (Table 1.). Annual distributions, often in 1-degree or 5-degree spatial areas were used to improve the redistribution of spatial mapping from initial processing for the appropriate tuna taxa and associated fishing gears. 

1.7 Adjustment using satellite data

Most recently it has been possible to track the movement of large vessels at sea from satellites. Though there are dedicated systems such as satellite vessel monitoring systems (VMS) used extensively in fisheries management, these data are not widely available nor do they cover most global fishing operations. Most recently the use of AIS positional vessel tracking has shown promise. With considerable processing, it has even been possible to determine not only if the vessel is a fishing vessel but even something about the associated fishing gears in used and possibly vessel size [1]. Unfortunately, the AIS coverage has only become good in 2016 and is still weak in some areas such as SE Asia due to many factors [12]. Where possible, however, especially for offshore fishing for tuna, these data can add another valuable source of information about fishing distributions. AIS data from 2016 was used to constrain the mapping of relevant catches for 2015 and, with reducing effect, for fishing years back to 2010. Before 2010 it was considered that recent AIS data could not improve mapping procedures.

1.8 Mapping historical data (pre-1950)

A number of data sources describe country fisheries landings, sometimes by taxa, as early as Roman times. In limited cases, reconstructions exist for some stocks such as Atlantic herring and cod for nearly 1000 years[13]. Here the sources described in Table 1 were used as the basis for extending mapped reported landings to 1869. The procedure used was similar to that described for more recent (post-1950) industrial fisheries (above). The spatial guide used was based on the same reporting country and fished taxon in 1950. If there was no such matching record then the time period used was generalised to any fishing in the 1950s. If this failed then the fished taxon was generalised to a broader taxonomic range. Using this method, it was possible to map all available historical records. 

1.9 Revision modifications from 2018 version

Over the past four months a new and revised release of the mapped global catch database (1950-2015) has been prepared. The mapped data was recreated from sources as previously described [16]. Thanks to users it was found that the 2018 previous version had not completely addressed spatial artefacts caused when national statistics were reported only in one of the major FAO statistical reporting area that comprise their national exclusive economic zone. This had left unexplained unfished areas in some years. This was addressed in the current revision where possible.

There was also revision to assumptions about the scale of unreported catch by ‘non-industrial’ fisheries which has changed totals and the ratio of industrial to non-industrial catch. The split relies on factors such as decadal/country (but see below), fished taxa and associated fishing gear. 

It was recognised that there must be a formal way of expressing the proportion of catch that a country reports that is from the non-industrial sector and a way of calculating how this changes annually. Although PhD candidate at the University of Tasmania, Yannick Rousseau has shown that this is a difficult problem – not the least because of the complexity and diversity of how fishing sectors are defined internationally, it is possible to make some progress. For example, it is possible to know the breakdown of country fleets annually by their power class (Rousseau PhD thesis) and this can be related to the gross tonnage (GT) of fishing vessels using the relationship published in the supplemental work (Appendix B Tonnage kilowatt conversions) of earlier global fishing effort data constructions [17]. This makes it possible to use the average power for each class to be converted to GT. This tonnage is a better representation of anticipated fishing power. According to Rousseau (in progress), the cut-off value for power classes with the closest match to most recognised definitions of ‘small-scale’ (here termed non-industrial) fishing would be his PO4 class. Therefore, the proportion for each country/year of that GT total versus all GT was used to calculate a 'GTSS4Factor' and used in calculations. It is, however, likely that all countries have some non-industrial fishing so rather than assuming a zero value where there was no data for this ratio – a nominal value of 0.05 was applied as a default. Thus, in addition to the fished taxa and it associated gear, this was used to split global catches to industrial and non-industrial. There were also minor revisions to the application of weighting based on gear-associated logistics on spatial cell candidates previously selected based on the range/distribution of fished taxa and fleet fishing access within statistical reporting areas.

As expected, totals in this revision were generally similar to the previous version, as were the associated spatial patterns. For most general purposes this revision does not require dependent analysis to be redone but the author should be consulted when in doubt.

            <description type="full">The Medical History Museum (1967-present) houses a research collection which documents the history of the University of Melbourne medical school from the mid 19th century, its teaching hospitals and achievements of its graduates from the 1860s to the present day and, more broadly, the history of medical practice in Victoria. The Medical History Museum holds over 4000 items which include objects, photographs, archives and ephemera. The Museum houses the reconstructed 1849 Savory and Moore Pharmacy. Three ornate display cases from the Melbourne Internal Exhibition 1880 hold microscopes, microtomes and surgical instruments from the early 1800s to the 1950s.

The Museum also holds an extensive collection of medical instruments and machines representing two hundred years of technology, as well as objects relating to public health. Other highlights include a collection of apothecary jars dating back to the 1600s; also a large photographic and archival collection relating to past graduates, prominent medicos and medical treatments over the last two centuries.

The Medical History Museum&amp;apos;s role is as a collecting museum, receiving and encouraging acquisitions to its growing collection, producing exhibitions, encouraging public access, providing guided tours, and also providing support for the academic programs within the University.</description>

            <description type="full">The primary aim of the SMLR Biological Survey was to determine the diversity and distribution of biological communities in the region. This was achieved by systematically surveying a range of survey quadrats that represented the biological variation over the study area.

Five surveys, conducted between 1977 and 2000 and comprising 1,177 vegetation quadrats in the survey region, contributed to the floristic analysis. Due to past vegetation clearance patterns, most of the survey quadrats were concentrated in the western two/thirds of the survey region. Survey quadrats were located on both crown and privately owned land. At least one survey quadrat was located in each of the National Parks and Wildlife Act reserves in the study region.
Three surveys, conducted between 1995 and 2000 and comprising 157 quadrats, contributed to the vertebrate analysis (these surveys also included vegetation quadrats). The major vertebrate survey fieldwork occurred in three separate periods, from autumn to early summer 2000. The vertebrate survey results were combined with previous records for the region to produce consolidated total species lists for each vertebrate category.

Two sites established for the Southern Mt Lofty Biological Survey have continued to have annual monitoring using the same standard sampling for ten years or more (see survey SU178). The sites were established in relatively intact Eucalyptus obliqua forest and in a paddock at the start of a revegetation program. The sampling will follow the establishment of more natural vegetation cover on the re-vegetated site and the fauna that establishes here over time. 

Two additional sites were also established under this project number for the Mt Osmond Reserve Survey carried out in April/May 2001 by Planning SA/DEH. The sites were in the same study area and used the BS methodology but probably should have their own project number. The Southern Mt Lofty Ranges Survey is part of the Biological Survey of South Australia Program which is a series of systematic surveys conducted across the state between 1971 and the present with the broad aim of providing a baseline inventory of South Australia's flora and fauna biodiversity.</description>

Taken from the 2009-2010 Progress Report:
Field work:
The samples obtained for this project so far have been collected as part of collecting cruises onboard Aurora Australis (CEAMARC 2008), 'Polarstern' 2008 (Wedell Sea), Tangaroa (Ross Sea) and other international cruises mostly those from Bristish Antarctic Survey. These samplings have provided excellent material of the project.

Research teams from the AAD, particularly the diving program led by Dr. Jonny Stark, co-investigator of the project have also made contributions of sea spiders material.

Laboratory activity/analysis:
Laboratory activities consist of:

DNA extraction, amplification and sequencing:
665 samples of sea spiders fro the mentioned collections have been processed for sequencing at the Barcoding facility in Guelph, Canada which sequence a fragment of the mitochondrial gene Cytochorme Oxidase I (COI) currently used as the barcoding gene.

In the meantime, 620 samples in total have been processed for sequencing at the Queensland Museum to obtain a fragment of the mitochondrial gene 16S, providing complementary resolution to that provided by COI.

Microscopy for taxonomic identification:
-The large size and unsorted condition of the collection from CEAMARC deposited in Paris has slowed down the progress of the project and the microscopic identification. 40% of the material has been sorted and identified to at least genus level.

-Description of two new species is currently in progress.

Pycnogonids are primitive, bizarre arthropods. Found worldwide, Antarctic pycnogonids are the most diverse, abundant, and include some of the most spectacular forms. Near 250 species from the region are known, many in need for taxonomic revision, and more species new to science likely to be found. This project will document diversity of pycnogonids and target widely distributed species to obtain morphological, genetic and ecological information on distribution patterns and evolutionary history. This combined approach should provide a better insight of the roles of sea spiders in Antarctic biodiversity and the evolution and radiation of Antarctic marine benthic fauna.

Project objectives:
1. To document the diversity of Australian Antarctic pycnogonids at species level and to target species with potential to investigate ecological interactions, zoogeographical patterns and genetic variability.

2. To examine connectivity patterns and genetic differentiation in populations of target species of pycnogonids across large spatial scales inferring diversification processes and possibly speciation rates.

3. To investigate the distribution patterns and possible mechanisms of dispersal of species with apparent wide distributions (e.g. circumpolar distribution, Antarctic -Pacific distribution and Antarctic-Arctic), based on molecular tools.

4. To explore how sea spiders fit evolutionary models testing the origin of deep sea fauna and proposing hypothesis for colonisation mechanisms and radiation processes, as many pycnogonid taxa from the deep sea are also represented on the continental shelf.

5. To resolve phylogenetic questions regarding the affinities among Antarctic species and lower latitude species to understand the evolutionary history of a highly diverse and cosmopolitan lineage (Callipallenidae-Nymphonidae).

Details from previous years are available for download from the provided URL.

Taken from the 2009-2010 Progress Report:

Objective 1
- During this second year of the project more than 500 lots of unsorted samples of pycnogonids are being sorted and identified, many to species level.
-In July 2009, 130 lots from the Ross Sea and Subantarctic areas deposited at NIWA in NZ, were sorted, identified and many of them barcoded. Some material has been requested on loan to continue taxonomic studies probably leading to description of new species.

-In November 2009, more than 330 lots of CEAMARC samples of sea spiders were received on loan from the Natural History Museum in Paris, where they were deposited in 2008. This material is extremely relevant not only for its diversity but also numbers of individuals per sample. CEAMARC samples (including additional 136 samples from AAD) have provided a unique opportunity to obtain appropriate numbers of individuals of target species such Nymphon australe, with more than 1000 individuals collected. This material is currently being used in analyses about genetic differentiation and diversity at different spatial scales.

-Current work in progress on the species level identification of the CEAMARC material would lead to a proper characterisation of the pycnogonid fauna from an extremely important area of the Australian Antarctic territory. We have identified Nymphon australe, Colossendeis megalonyx, Nymphon spp., Austropallene spp. and Pallenopsis spp, as the most frequent and abundant Australian Antarctic pycnogonids and it is expected to correlate abundance and occurrence patterns to other biotic and abiotic parameters that could explain the numbers and diversity of these taxa in the area.

- I co-authored a pioneering paper with H. Griffiths (senior author) from BAS and others, on the diversity and biogeography of Antarctic pycnogonids, which was submitted last month to journal Ecography.

- At least two new species to science are to be described based on CEAMARC material currently studied.

Objective 2

-There is a publication in press (Arango et al.) in the journal Deep-Sea Research II presenting a genetic analysis of the most abundant Antarctic sea spider species Nymphon australe. The study includes 131 individuals of N. australe collected from Antarctic Peninsula, Weddell Sea and East Antarctica.

-Additional material of N. australe from CEAMARC made available by MNHN in Paris is currently being analysed to expand the published study and focus on the possible explanations for such wide distribution of a species with apparent limited dispersal capabilities.

- Just recently, I established research collaboration with Dr. F. Leese at Ruhr University Bochum, Germany, who is currently interested in the population genetics and genetic connectivity of Antarctic sea spiders. This collaborative effort should prove to be very successful in terms of geographic cover of samples, molecular markers used and analyses implemented.

Objective 3

-The paper in press mentioned above addresses the question of circumpolarity of N. australe and finds it might be one of the few 'true' circumpolar species given that the dataset does not reflect cryptic speciation. Preliminary data for other species are showing contrasting results and might reflect 'unknown' species considered cryptic or perhaps just reflects necessity of fine detail taxonomy. This work on Colossendeis megalonyx is partly in collaboration with Leese's team in Germany.

-Material from New Zealand, Tasmania and NSW are currently used for analysis on phylogenetic affinities between Antarctic and non-Antarctic taxa, and also to compare patterns of genetic differentiation among different habitats and taxa. Achelia species distributed from Antarctica to tropical areas will be looked at in a future project depending on funding.

Objective 4

-Objective 4 part of a proposal submitted to Australian Biological Resources Study (ABRS) to study deep phylogeny and divergence times of Pycnogonida to understand evolutionary links between Antarctic, deep-sea and Australian shallow waters species, in collaboration with J. Strugnell. During the first and second year of the project advances have been made in terms of literature review, discussion with specialists and most importantly acquisition of material for molecular work that will complement the dataset published in 2007 (Arango and Wheeler 2007).

Objective 5

- Since September 2009 I have been actively working on constructing datasets for phylogenetic analyses of Nymphon, the most diverse and abundant taxon of sea spiders in the world, and their closest relatives, the callipallenids, with centre of diversity in Australasia. I am working on including morphological and molecular characters for as many representative species as possible. So far, 30 species are included, and at least 50 morphological are being scored. More species are desired, so I am permanently seeking donation of material, collaborations, etc. the genes COI and 16S are sequenced for at least 50% of the samples included so far, I am currently investigating other molecular markers that might be suitable to resolve a phylogeny at this level.

- Given the availability of material from many different species of Colossendeidae, and the relevance and impact of this group being the family of the giant sea spiders, I am currently collecting material (i.e. tissue samples, DNA sequences, morphological descriptions) to work on the phylogeny of this cosmopolitan family with more than 40 species in the Southern Ocean. At least 15 species have been sequenced so far. The same techniques and methodology as for the Nymphon phylogeny are being applied.</description>

Variations to work plan or objectives:
The only variation has been to geographically extend Objective 3 to analyse the potentially significant impact of very thick fast ice on the dynamic and calving behaviour of the floating Mertz Glacier Tongue (see Section 1.1 above). It is anticipated that this extension will enhance the project, by highlighting a previously overlooked yet potentially important process affecting floating glacier tongue/ice shelf breakup, whereby strong coupling between very thick perennial sea ice and continental ice provides stability in certain ice sheet margin regions. It also enhances the link with AAS Project #2698 (PI: Warner), on which Dr Massom is a Co-I ("Antarctica - past, present, and future: exploring the dynamic interactions of ice sheet and ice shelves within the global climate system through computer modeling").

Field work:
This is predominantly a remote sensing-based project. However, in situ and airborne observations of fast ice acquired during SIPEX (V1 2007/8) by other projects on which the PI (Massom) is a Co-I (#2901 and 3030) may prove to be useful in helping to interpret satellite laser altimeter-based estimates of fast ice thickness. Moreover, and given its extreme age and thickness, possible biological importance and glaciological significance (see 3 below), the region of perennial fast ice to the immediate east of the Mertz Glacier tongue is a prime candidate for a future multi-disciplinary field measurement campaign. Such measurements would address current major unknowns affecting our satellite altimeter-based estimates of the fast ice thickness, including snow cover thickness and density and ice density.</description>

The proposed research will derive improved estimates of East Antarctic fast-ice extent and thickness, and their variability, from satellite data. These will be used to explicitly test relationships between fast ice/other environmental parameters and Emperor penguin population dynamics. We shall also combine observations with a wave-ice shelf-sea ice interaction model to test the hypothesis that catastrophic ice shelf break-up events on the E. Antarctic Peninsula are linked to increased ocean wave energy associated with sea-ice extent anomalies (driven by atmospheric anomalies), and/or long-period swell from far-remote storms. This work will aid comprehension of processes responsible for recent rapid ice-shelf demise.

Project objectives:
1. To measure and monitor East Antarctic fast ice areal extent and thickness, and their spatio-temporal variability, using satellite remote sensing.

2) To analyse the impact of fast ice variability on the breeding success of Emperor penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri).

3) To investigate the potential impact of sea ice on recent ice shelf break-up breakup on the Antarctic Peninsula.

Taken from the 2008-2009 Progress Report:
This project has shown a strong correlation between interannual fast ice variability and Emperor penguin breeding success at Dumont d'Urville, and has produced satellite-based maps of East Antarctic fast ice (radar snapshot mosaics from November 1997/98 and 20-day composite images for 2005-2008, extending back to 2000). Secondly, significant progress was made towards implicating an atmospherically-driven anomalous lack of sea ice in recent Antarctic ice-shelf disintegrations. Finally, new research highlights a previously-overlooked mechanical coupling between the floating Mertz Glacier tongue and very thick (greater than 25m) and old (greater than 20yrs) fast ice attached to it, with important implications for ice-sheet margin stability.

Taken from the 2009-2010 Progress Report:
Progress against objectives:
1) To measure and monitor East Antarctic fast ice areal extent and thickness, and their spatio-temporal variability, using satellite remote sensing.

Considerable progress has been made against this objective, building on last year's publication of the first detailed "snapshot" maps of landfast sea ice (fast ice) extent around the East Antarctic coast from 75 degrees E-170 degrees E for the Novembers of 1997 and 1999 using RADARSAT satellite ScanSAR images (see Giles et al., 2008). The main achievements are:

* The development of an improved semi-automated method to successfully derive fast ice extent (and pack ice motion) from time series of Envisat Advanced SAR images (Giles et al., in prep.), via a project with the European Space Agency and the International Space Science Institute (Berne, Switzerland). Fast ice is identified as regions of zero motion in the cross-correlation analysis of carefully co-registered pairs of satellite SAR images.

* Significant progress in the PhD project (Alex Fraser) aimed at deriving longer and near-continuous time series of fast ice extent from time series of NASA MODIS visible and thermal IR imagery at 1 km resolution. A major challenge has been to address the problem of effectively 'removing' persistent cloud cover from the images. This has been achieved by compositing many thousands of MODIS images to create 20-day composite images of the entire East Antarctic coastal zone from 10W to 170E. This technique was showcased at the prestigious International Geoscience and Remote Sensing 2009 conference in South Africa in July 2009 (Fraser et al., 2009a), with subsequent publication by Fraser et al. (2009b). During the year, this work resulted in an important new time series of fast ice extent that runs from 2000 to 2008 inclusive (Fraser et al., in prep.), with techniques being described in Fraser et al. (in press). This unique dataset represents by far the most detailed estimate of East Antarctic fast ice and its spatio-temporal variability to date. It furthermore represents an important new baseline against which to gauge change, given that Antarctic fast ice is a key yet poorly understood component of the global cryosphere (and ocean freshwater budget), is of immense ecological significance (see 2 below), and is a sensitive indicator of climate change/variability. This baseline is directly comparable to the more familiar overall sea ice (pack ice) extent product. Work is underway to determine why large regional differences occur in fast ice distribution and behaviour, including analysis of the role of bathymetry, grounded icebergs and changes in wind patterns. This work also provides crucial regional-scale fast ice information in support of detailed localised fast ice measurements carried out within the Antarctic Fast Ice network at Casey and Davis (AAS 3032).

* A collaborative project has been established with Drs Fricker (USA) and Legresy (France) to estimate the thickness of a large region of perennial fast ice adjacent and attached to the Mertz Glacier Tongue. This has been achieved by combining satellite imagery with surface elevation data from the NASA's ICESat laser altimeter satellite, although current unknowns include the thickness and density of the overlying snowcover. The results suggest that this fast ice is extraordinarily thick i.e. greater than 25 m, and may be at least 20 years old (Massom et al., subm., a). Work examining the glaciological significance of this extremely thick fast ice is described in 3 (below). Work is also underway to evaluate the impact on this and regional fast ice of the major calving of the Mertz Glacier in February 2010.

2) To analyse the impact of fast ice variability on the breeding success of Emperor penguins

The first element of this multi-disciplinary, international study was completed last year i.e. a case study showing strong links between Emperor penguin breeding success at Dumont d'Urville and fast ice distribution along the Adelie Land coast of East Antarctica and its variability due to variability in the regional wind field. Results were published in Marine Ecology Progress Series (Massom et al., 2009a), and were also presented in a keynote address to the Xth SCAR International Biology Symposium in September 2009. Work is underway to extend this study both temporally and to other species and regions, using the new MODIS-derived time series of 20-day composite maps of fast ice extent (see 1 above). This work will include a comparison of the fast ice information with new data from French penguin scientists (Drs Barbraud, Ancel and LeMayo) on Emperor penguin mortality and other demographic parameters, with a view to discovering links between the penguin demographics and fast ice variability due to changing weather patterns. Further work is in its initial stages to study the impact of fast ice variability on i) Weddell seal foraging behaviour (with Dr Hindell's group at the Univ. of Tasmania), ii) Adelie penguin breeding success and foraging behaviour (with Drs Southwell and Emmerson, AAD), and iii) other Emperor penguin colonies in East Antarctica (with Dr Wienecke, AAD). Ongoing/future work will also evaluate the impact of abrupt change on the seals and penguins at Dumont d'Urville following the Mertz Glacier calving in February 2010.</description>

Taken from the 2008-2009 Progress Report:
Variations to work plan or objectives:
With greatly reduced field work possible in the 2008/09 season, the work plan for this project has been modified this year. The experiments planned to be conducted in situ in Antarctica over the 0809 summer season will now be done over the 2009 winter in the Ecotoxicology aquarium facilities at Kingston. The lack of project personnel and the short field season on station this past season will certainly result in changes to the future work plan, and attempts will be made to maximise time on station for several project personnel over the next 2 to 3 seasons to enable this project to be completed.

Field work:
A short field season of approximately 5 weeks was conducted at Casey in 2008/09 with a team of 6 scientists working together on an intensive marine sampling program under TRENZ (AAS project 2948, CI Stark) in support of 5 different AAS projects including this one. Sampling of live invertebrates for this project was done in various habitats at several locations on the coast close to Casey. Sampling was done by dip netting, grab samples, dredges, traps, and by snorkellers. No in situ experimental field work was possible over this short season with such a small team. Hopefully berths on station will be less limited over the next 2 to 3 seasons, the Marine Ecotoxicology aquarium field module will be completed and taken south as cargo, and the dive program will take place at Davis station. With a larger team available to work on this project, and more time allocated to be on station, we should be able to generate the data required to complete this project over the next few years. It is anticipated that our project team will spend 4-6 months at Davis station this year working with the dive team and using the field aquarium module currently being built by the STS workshop.

Laboratory activity/analysis:
Laboratory experiments were not possible at Casey this season for reasons discussed previously. Experiments with live invertebrates will therefore be conducted in the marine ecotoxicology aquarium here at Kingston over the next months prior to the 2009/10 field season. It is anticipated that with the capability of the Ecotoxicology aquarium here at Kingston and the Marine Ecotoxicology aquarium field module that laboratory based toxicity tests will be able to be run almost year, so long as adequate support is provided to the maintenance of these aquarium facilities in the future. 

Difficulties affecting project:
The main difficulty experienced in this project was the lack of available berths for the 2008/09 (and the previous 2007/08) season. While this has delayed progress, it is unlikely to affect the overall outcomes of the project in the long term and has not resulted in significant changes to the project objectives or design. In addition, we have modified the project to include more use of the cold water facilities at Kingston which hopefully when fully developed will enable experiments to be carried out year round. 

Taken from the 2009-2010 Progress Report:
Field work:
A field season was conducted at Davis in 2009/10 with 2 project personnel. Sampling of live invertebrates for this project was done in various habitats at several locations on the coast close to Davis. Sampling sites were accessed either by IRB, helicopter or on foot. Sampling was done by dip netting and by snorkellers.

Laboratory activity/analysis:
Laboratory experiments were conducted at Davis this season using live invertebrates. Unfortunately the decommissioning of the Ecotoxicology Lab at Kingston means that laboratory experimentation will be limited to field seasons in the immediate future until upgrades and modifications can be completed.</description>

While it is generally thought that Antarctic organisms are highly sensitive to pollution, there is little data to support or disprove this. Such data is essential if realistic environmental guidelines, which take into account unique physical, biological and chemical characteristics of the Antarctic environment, are to be developed. Factors that modify bioavailability, and the effects of common contaminants on a range of Antarctic organisms from micro-algae to macro-invertebrates will be examined. Risk assessment techniques developed will provide the scientific basis for prioritising contaminated site remediation activities in marine environments, and will contribute to the development of guidelines specific to Antarctica.

Project objectives:
1. Develop and use toxicity tests to characterise the responses of a range of Antarctic marine invertebrates, micro- and macro-algae to common inorganic and organic contaminants.

2. To examine factors controlling bioavailability and the influence of physical, chemical and biological properties unique to the Antarctic environment on the bioavailability and toxicity of contaminants to biota.

3. To compare the response of Antarctic biota to analogous species in Arctic, temperate and tropical environments in order to determine the applicability of using toxicity data and environmental guidelines developed in other regions of the world for use in the Antarctic.

4. Develop a suite of standard bioassay techniques using Antarctic species to assess the toxicity of mixtures of contaminants (aqueous and sediment-bound) including tip leachates, sewage effluents and contaminated sediments.

5. To establish risk assessment models to predict the potential hazards associated with contaminated sites in Antarctica to marine biota, and to develop Water and Sediment Quality Guidelines for Antarctica to set as targets for the remediation of contaminated marine environments. 

Taken from the 2008-2009 Progress Report:
Progress against objectives:
Due to logistical constraints, only a short field season (5 weeks) was conducted at Casey in 2008/09 and no berths were allocated solely to this project. A team of 6 scientists worked together on an intensive marine sampling program under TRENZ (AAS project 2948, CI Stark) in support of 5 different AAS projects, including this one. The lack of adequate personnel dedicated to this project and the limited time that we were allocated on station hindered progress and meant that no experiments on Antarctic organisms were able to be conducted in situ. The airlink was however successfully used to transport marine invertebrates collected at Casey and held in seawater at 0degC back to Hobart on 3 separate flights. These invertebrates are currently being maintained in the cold water ecotoxicology aquarium facilities at Kingston. Once they are sorted and where possible established in cultures, they will be used in toxicity tests.

Progress against specific objects are:
1) Much effort and time has been put towards the husbandry and culture of the collected Antarctic marine invertebrates. Some species are now successfully breeding in the laboratory providing new generations and sensitive juvenile stages of invertebrates to work with in toxicity tests. This culturing capability, if able to be developed, will hugely extend opportunities for carrying out research for this project, by giving us access to live material over the winter months and during summer when berths to or space on station in Antarctica is limited. Toxicity tests using some of the common amphipods and gastropods collected in the 0809 season at Casey will commence shortly at Kingston.
2) Toxicity tests to commence shortly using invertebrates collected in the 0809 season now being maintained in the Ecotoxicology aquarium will focus on interactions and potentially synergistic effects of contaminants along with other environmental stressors including increases in temperature and decreases in salinity associated with predicted environmental changes in response to climate change.
3) A phD candidate has recently started on this project and is currently reviewing all available literature on the response of Antarctic species to contaminants and environmental stressors in comparison to related species from lower latitudes.
4) Invertebrates collected in the 0809 season that are being maintained in the Ecotoxicology aquarium will be screened in toxicity tests to commence shortly. Methods will then be developed using the most suitable and sensitive species to form the basis of standard bioassay procedures that can be used to test mixtures such as sewage effluents and tip leachates in the upcoming season.
5) The establishment of risk assessment models and Environmental Quality Guidelines for Antarctica is a long term goal of this project when data from the first 4 objectives can be synthesised and hence has not yet been addressed. 

Taken from the 2009-2010 Progress Report:
Progress against objectives:
Objectives 1 and 2: Metal effects on the behaviour and survival of three marine invertebrate species were investigated during the field season. Two replicate toxicity tests were conducted on the larvae of sea urchin Sterechinus neumayeri where combined effects of metal (copper and cadmium) and temperature (-1, 1 and 3 degrees Celsius) were to be investigated on developmental success. However, due to lower than optimal fertilisation success, both tests were terminated before any meaningful results could be derived.

Four tests were conducted on the adult amphipod, Paramorea walkeri. Two replicate tests investigated combined metal (copper and cadmium) and temperature (-1, 1 and 3 degrees Celsius) effects, and two tests investigated the effects of copper, cadmium, lead, zinc and nickel exposure at ambient sea water temperature of -1 degrees Celsius.

One test was conducted with the micro-gastropod Skenella paludionoides being exposed to copper, cadmium, lead, zinc and nickel at ambient sea water temperature.

The larvae of bivalve Laternula sp. were also investigated as a potential test organism for metal toxicity. Strip spawning was conducted a number of times, however, this technique did not provide adequate levels of fertilisation success and as such, the toxicity tests on larval development were not completed.

Objective 3: A phD candidate working on this project is in the process of compiling a review of all available date on the response of Antarctic species to contaminants and environmental stressors in comparison to related species from lower latitudes. This literature review will form a major component of her thesis' first chapter

Objective 4: Methods for Standard bioassay procedures were developed using the most suitable and sensitive species, the amphipod Paramoera walkeri and the microgastropod Skenella paludionoides. These standard tests were then used to assess the toxicity of sewage effluent at Davis Station (in conjunction with project 3217).

Objective 5: Toxicity tests on sewage effluent were conducted as part of a risk assessment to determine hazards associated with the current discharge. The determined toxicity of the sewage effluent will provide a basis for guideline recommendations on the required level of treatment and on what constitutes an adequate or 'safe' dilution factor for dispersal of the effluent discharge to the near shore marine environment.</description>
