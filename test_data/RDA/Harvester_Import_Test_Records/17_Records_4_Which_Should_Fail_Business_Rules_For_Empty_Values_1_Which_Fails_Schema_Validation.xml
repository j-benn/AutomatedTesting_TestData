      <description type="full">Dr Alistair Melzer is a senior research fellow within the Centre for Environmental Management at Central Queensland University.He has been with the Centre since 1994 and since then he has developed applied technical programmes and research relationships with regional industry and the community. These relationships have been broadly based and multi-disciplinary in nature. They support inquiry into terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystem and environmental health questions by senior research staff. Dr Melzer is a terrestrial ecologist with expertise in plant and animal ecology. His personal research interests are in the ecology of koalas, the capacity of fragmented landscapes to sustain fauna and the indicators of rehabilitation success.

Dr Melzer has provided impartial, expert advice to community, industry, state (New South Wales and Queensland) and federal agencies and local governments on a variety of environmental issues associated with conservation biology, biodiversity management, environmental risks associated with water management and coastal industrial development as well as environmental policy interpretation. </description>

      <description type="full" xml:lang="en">Photographic images are useful tools for environmental historians and have their place alongside the official documents generated by environmental regulators and managers, and the unofficial written observations and oral testimonies of everyday citizens attuned to their natural surroundings. The Historical Coastlines project developed an historical image and manuscript archive illustrative and informative of physical environmental change in the Fitzroy River estuary and on the Capricorn Coast. The archive was compiled as a first port of call for individuals, scientists and community groups who, for instance, might be interested in researching historical change in specific locations, or baseline biophysical data, or to demonstrate land use patterns, illustrate cultural continuities, or simply to satisfy their curiosity about the past states and uses of these local environments. The photographs in the Historical Coastlines archive were taken for the most part over the past 130 years by residents of the Rockhampton/Capricorn Coast region for their own pleasure, usually to capture and preserve memories of pleasant scenes and happy holidays. The image archive, collected, initially from institutional repositories, in particular the Capricornia Collection of the CQU Library, the Rockhampton and District Historical Society collection, the Emu Park Historical Museum collection, and the Capricorn Coast Historical Society collection, contains 764 photographs. As part of the project local historians also undertook the laborious and time-consuming process of accurately identifying and dating the images.</description>

      <description type="full" xml:lang="en">A key focus of the project was identifying how different communities view housing needs and development options. A survey was conducted in the three communities of Moura, Biloela and Theodore in Central Queensland to assess future population and development trends of the relevant population groups. The case studies were assessed in the context of being potential service communities for the nearby Dawson coal mine.
The survey comprised of two parts: general questions and the Choice Modelling part.
The first part of the survey focused on questions related to
- Residency and housing history of participants,
- perceptions of the community they live in,
- future housing preferences,
- views about current coal mining development,
- attitudes towards current high housing demands,
- factors that have caused stress in household, and
- socio-demographic characteristics of respondents.
The second part of the survey focused on presentation of the Choice Modelling questions and three options were offered to respondents in four different versions of the survey. There were also some follow up questions after the choice sets to explore reasons why different patterns of choice had been followed.
The majority of the respondents contacted lived in the towns, with some on rural properties surrounding Theodore and a total of 318 surveys were collected. </description>

      <description type="full" xml:lang="en">This dataset details the results of 2 workshops held within the Desert Uplands region at Barcaldine and Jericho and designed around the use of an experimental &amp;amp;lsquo;game&amp;amp;rsquo; developed specifically for this project. A series of dummy properties were developed that combined to form a grid of 12 properties. The workshops involved up to 12 landholders, and lasted for approximately 3 &amp;amp;ndash; 4 hours. Each participant in the game was randomly allocated one of the 12 properties available. Property sizes, vegetation types and development levels were typical of the range of important characteristics in the Desert Uplands region. In a session round, each participant was asked to nominate an area of their dummy property that they might manage more conservatively. They also had to nominate the annual payment that they would require over a five year period before they would enter into a voluntary agreement. Participants providing the most cost-effective bids were rewarded.</description>

      <description type="brief">Spatial patterns in benthic infaunal community structure of Port Curtis estuary (north-eastern Australia) were determined from quantitative grab samples and examined in relation to environmental variables. A total of 149 riverine, estuarine and open coastal stations were sampled during the survey, and 5744 individuals and 466 species identified.</description>
      <description type="brief">Sediments: Two sediment sub-samples (70ml and 10ml) were retained from each replicate grab sample prior to sieving. These fractions were collected from the surface layer by scraping an open vial across the top of each sample. The sediments collected were snap-frozen and stored at -20&amp;amp;deg;C, before being examined for size structure and organic carbon content. The 70ml sediment sub-samples were wet-sieved through an agitated stack of Endecott sieves, with apertures of 2mm, 1mm, 500&amp;amp;mu;m, 250&amp;amp;mu;m, 125&amp;amp;mu;m and 63&amp;amp;mu;m. Fractions retained on each sieve were oven dried (105&amp;amp;deg;C) and weighed, and their masses used to estimate the median diameter of the sediment in each grab. This parameter was subsequently used to investigate relationships between faunal composition and sediment structure. Correlations between faunal composition and the amount or organic material in the sediments were also investigated. 10ml of sediment from each grab was oven dried (105&amp;amp;deg;C for 24h) to remove all moisture. The sample was then ground to a talcum-power consistency in a mortar and pestle, and the carbonates removed by acid digestion (20ml, 0.5M HCl for 1h). Following washing in distilled water the sediment samples were oven-dried (105&amp;amp;deg;C for 24h) and weighed. The samples were then ashed in a muffle furnace (660&amp;amp;deg;C for 1h), before being reweighed. The percentage organic carbon content of each grab sample was estimated from the loss in weight following ignition.</description>
      <description type="brief">Macrobenthos: Spatial variations in the benthic community structure of Port Curtis were determined from quantitative grab samples collected at 149 sampling station. These stations were arranged on 2 adjacent grid arrays (1.5km2 - inner harbour; 3km2 - outer harbour) that extended to cover the entire body of the port. This sampling design included riverine, estuarine and open coastal reaches of the waterway, and encompassed bedforms of varying depth throughout the study area.All sampling was conducted over a seven-week winter period (17 July to 3 September 2002) using two vessels with customised grabs. A light-weight 0.1m2 van Veen grab was primarily used for sampling soft muddy sediments in the inner harbour, while a heavier 0.1m2 Smith McIntyre grab was employed for sampling firm sand and shell-sand substrates in the outer harbour. Except for differences in weight, both grabs were armed with identical sized buckets and collected similar volumes of sediment. However, to limit variation in efficiency between grabs, all samples were weighed following removal of the supernatant liquid and only those containing 10kg or above retained. A total of 3 replicate grabs were collected from each of the 149 sampling station with the skipper holding the vessel on site without anchor. Navigation to all stations was undertaken with a differential GPS that provided an accuracy of 3m or less in 95% of fixes. All grabs collected were sieved on a 1mm mesh screen and the fauna retained preserved in formaldehyde solution. This fauna was later sorted in the laboratory to the highest taxonomic level (generally species) before being counted.</description>
      <description type="brief">Water chemistry: A comprehensive water quality survey was undertaken at the same time as the grab sampling study. Measures of watertemperature, salinity, pH and dissolved oxygen content were collected from each of the 149 sampling station using an automated water quality analyser (YeoKal 611TM). This instrument was preset to acquire data at 1m intervals, and was lowered on a weighted cable through the water column at each station immediately prior to grabbing. Turbidity of the water column at each sampling station was measured using a 30cm diameter Secchi disk. This was lowered on a metered rope beneath the research vessel until no longer visible, and the depth at which this occurred was recorded. Measures of total chlorophyll concentration were also determined for surface waters at each sampling station following the procedures detailed in ISO 10260 (1992). Because it was recognised that sampling of water quality parameters would occur over an extended period (~7weeks), a control site was established to standardise temporal variation. This control site was located at channel marker A8 near the centre of the study area, approximately 500m north-east of the mouth of Auckland Creek. Measures for all water quality parameters under study were collected from this location each morning before sampling elsewhere. All results presented here have been standardised to water quality conditions observed on the first day of sampling (17 July 2002). Data analysis: A geographical information system (GIS) was employed to characterise and display spatial trends in environmental data. Physical, chemical and biological attributes for each sampling station were interpolated using an inverse distance weighting (IDW) algorithm (Cressie, 1993), and series of predictive maps constructed. These maps were used to visualise discontinuities between homogeneous regions and highlight patterns of similarity between variables. Relationships between each environmental variable were subsequently tested using Pearsons correlation coefficients. Variations in benthic community structure between the 149 Port Curtis stations were examined using Bray-Curtis dissimilarity measures (Bray and Curtis, 1957). This dissimilarity measure was chosen because it is not affected by joint absences, it gives more weighting to abundant than rare species, and it has consistently performed well in preserving ecological distance in a variety of simulations on different types of data (Field et al., 1982; Faith et al., 1987). Single square root transformations were applied to the data to prevent abundant species from influencing the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity measures excessively (Clarke and Green, 1988; Clarke, 1993). Multivariate analyses were conducted using the computer package PRIMER (Clarke and Gorley, 2001). Hierarchical agglomerative clustering was used to group sites according to their infaunal community composition, and a similarity percentage test (SIMPER) conducted to determine those species contributing most to within and between site groupings. The extent to which measured environmental variables (temperature, salinity, pH, DO, turbidity, chlorophyll, sediment structure and organic carbon) could account for observed community groupings was further tested using the BIOENV routine of Clarke and Ainsworth (1993).</description>

      <description type="full">&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The carbon estimates in this dataset were taken from “Avocet”, a grazing property, located approximately 32 km south of Emerald in Central Queensland and located within the Brigalow Belt Bioregion, and includes vegetation categorised in 18 Regional Ecosystems. As the property included such a wide range of Regional Ecosystems (REs) it was decided to sample only eight of the REs, and to apply the information from these sites to the other REs. At each RE one general area (site) was selected to be representative of the vegetation. Trees were measured in 200m2 rectangular plots called transects. 30 transects were laid out at each site. Each transect was 50 metres long and 4 metres wide, and all were laid in a north-south direction. All trees over 1.8 m were measured in the first three transects. The stem circumference of each tree selected was measured at a height of 30 cm above the ground. From this measurement, the tree biomass was calculated using previously developed equations, which relate stem circumference, or in some cases, stem diameter, to total above-ground biomass. The dataset contains all above and below ground tree carbon data for the property and associated calculations.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

      <description type="full" xml:lang="en">The Sustainable Landscape Program (SLP) was a grant program run by the Mackay Whitsunday NRM Group for landholders in the region. Between August 2005 and May 2006 almost 300 agreements were signed with about 200 land managers for approximately $1.72 million in funding agreements. This study is a review of the grant program and involved a survey of landholders who had been involved with the program. For the data collection with landholders, a telephone survey of participants in the SLP was conducted with a sample of 133 contact names by the Population Research Laboratory (PRL) at Central Queensland University using computer assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) technology. Prior to telephone data collection each participant was sent a single page letter which informed them of the impending review, offered information about the review, gave them prior knowledge of the times which PRL staff would be calling and gave them the opportunity to call the PRL&amp;amp;rsquo;s toll free number if they wished to make an appointment. The survey questionnaire was organized in five parts for a total of 43 questions: &amp;amp;bull; A standardized introduction &amp;amp;bull; Demographic questions &amp;amp;bull; The participation of the Land Managers &amp;amp;bull; Their views on the SLP &amp;amp;bull; Their general attitudes on incentive programs. The resultant data were tabulated and cleaned using SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) version 13.0 and contained 113 responses, giving an overall response rate of 85% to the survey. This was a high participation rate for survey involvement providing indirect evidence of interest and support for the SLP. The SPSS program was used to generate descriptive statistics and for the conduct of statistical tests to assess relationships between answers to different survey questions</description>

      <description type="full">&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The carbon estimates in this dataset were taken from “Berrigurra” a cattle grazing property located approximately 27 km west of Blackwater, and located within the Brigalow Belt Bioregion and includes vegetation categorised in 13 Regional Ecosystems. As the property included such a wide range of Regional Ecosystems (REs) it was decided to sample only six of the REs, and to apply the measurements from these sites to the other REs. At each RE one general area (site) was selected to be representative of the vegetation. Trees were measured in 200m2 rectangular plots called transects. 30 transects were laid out at each site. Each transect was 50 metres long and 4 metres wide, and all were laid in a north-south direction. All trees over 1.8 metres were measured in the first three transects. The stem circumference of each tree selected was measured at a height of 30 cm above the ground. From this measurement, the tree biomass was calculated using previously developed equations, which relate stem circumference, or in some cases, stem diameter, to total above-ground biomass. The dataset contains all above and below ground tree carbon data for the property and associated calculations.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

      <description type="full" xml:lang="en">This dataset details water samples collected across the flood hydrograph at the pontoon of the Fitzroy Motor Boat Club downstream of the Fitzroy River Barrage in Rockhampton. A number of samples were also collected at the Fitzroy River mouth during the 2004 floods as well as three stormwater samples from urban runoff in south Rockhampton in early January 2005.
Sixteen sediment grab samples were obtained in August 2004 (survey 268, c/-
Lynda Radke, Geoscience Australia). Due to project budget constraints, only nine samples (which were closest to the mouth of the river) were analysed for PAHs to obtain some idea of levels of organic contaminants in the surface sediments.
Additional surface benthic sediments were obtained in August and December
2005 from the main channel of the Fitzroy River downstream of the Barrage, as
well as from a few sites upstream of the Barrage.
A 2.6 m sediment core (277VC20A) from Keppel Bay was obtained using a
vibracorer in September 2004 (c/- Geoscience Australia); location: -23.50329°,
150.95235°. The core was sliced into 3–5 cm thick sections, in order to have
adequate mass (minimum 75 g wet sediment) for the analyses of low-level PAH
contaminants. Fifteen (of the 78 total) slices were analysed for PAHs, while 23 other slices were analysed for metals.
Due to limited time and budget to undertake further sampling, some archived (V.
Vicente-Beckett, CQU) Keppel Bay sediments (obtained in 1998), main Fitzroy
Channel sediments (obtained in 2002), and a sediment core (3410) taken at the
mouth of Raglan Creek in the Fitzroy Estuary (obtained by hydraulic coring from
the RV Lady Basten, c/- Australian Institute of Marine Science) were included in
this study in order to obtain a more extensive picture of sediment metal contents in the Fitzroy Estuary.</description>

      <description type="full" xml:lang="en">This dataset details the responses of a web-based survey from 1101 residents located along the Queensland Coast adjacent to the Great Barrier Reef (GBR).
The main aim of data collection was to elicit the details of travel trips to allow recreation values to be estimated for beaches, islands and boating trips, as the most relevant recreation activities in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP) respondents were asked about their visit frequency over the past two years to:
1. To their most frequented beach
2. To their second most frequented beach
3. To islands in the GBR area
4. On fishing, sailing or boating trips.
In each category respondents who had visited in the past two years were also asked to provide additional details about their visit experiences and the travel methods and costs involved in their most recent visit. The collection of data about visit rates was simplified by giving respondents visit categories to select, ranging from „everyday‟ through to „about once a year‟, consistent with previous studies (e.g. Anderson 2010).
In the contingent behaviour questions beach users were asked to identify if different environmental factors, facility issues or crowding had reduced their visit rates in the past, or would do so in the future. Recreational fishers were asked about the effect of different catch rates on their current and future visit patterns, while other water users were asked about the effects of decreased water visibility on current and future visit patterns. The final section of the survey involved questions about socio-demographic factors and the area where people lived.</description>

      <description type="full" xml:lang="en">This dataset represents the results of 250 surveys of angler groups who were shore fishing or returning to the boat ramp at Boondooma Dam.
Data collected from each visitor group on a number of variables includes:
• the number of people in the group,
• hours spent fishing on that day,
• place of residence (city and postcode),
• approximate distance travelled one-way,
• travel time in hours,
• trip cost for the entire group (travel costs, fishing costs for this trip, annual
boat expenses),
• mode of travel,
• number of days planning to fish this trip,
• length of the total trip, and
• number of fishing trips to the dam and other places in a year.</description>
