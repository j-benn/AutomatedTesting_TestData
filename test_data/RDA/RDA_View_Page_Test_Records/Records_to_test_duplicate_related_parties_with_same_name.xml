                &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Swedish Human Protein Atlas project, funded by the Knut and Alice Wallenberg
                Foundation, has been set up to allow for a systematic exploration of the human proteome using
                Antibody-Based Proteomics. This is accomplished by combining high-throughput generation of
                affinity-purified antibodies with protein profiling in a multitude of tissues and cells assembled in
                tissue microarrays. Confocal microscopy analysis using human cell lines is performed for more detailed
                protein localization. The program hosts the Human Protein Atlas portal with expression profiles of human
                proteins in tissues and cells.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The main sites are located at AlbaNova
                and SciLifeLab, KTH - Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden, the Rudbeck Laboratory, Uppsala
                University, Uppsala, Sweden and Lab Surgpath, Mumbai, India. The main objective of the resource centre
                is to produce specific antibodies to human target proteins using a high-throughput production method
                involving the cloning and protein expression of Protein Epitope Signature Tags (PrESTs). After
                purification, the antibodies are used to study expression profiles in cells and tissues and for
                functional analysis of the corresponding proteins in a wide range of platforms. The Stockholm sites are
                responsible for generating high-quality antibodies and to perform the immunofluorescence analysis, the
                Uppsala site is responsible for large-scale protein profiling in tissues and cells using
                immunohistochemistry and the Mumbai site for the annotation of the immunohistochemistry images.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

            <description type="full">&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Minutes of council meetings were created in accordance with section 145 of the Municipal Institutions Act 1863 (27 Vic., No.184) and with subsequent legislation relating to local government including the Local Government Act 1958 (No.6299). Many local government bodies in existence prior to 1863 maintained records of their meetings in the form of minutes.&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;These acts have required that for each meeting of council, minutes of all proceedings are recorded together with the names of all councillors present and all who vote for and against motions. The &amp;quot;master set&amp;quot; of minutes is also required to be signed by the mayor or chairman of the meeting once the minutes have been confirmed at the following council meeting. The minutes relate to the wide range of activities for which the council is responsible, including building, community services, collection of rates, property valuation and town planning. &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;The committee system is employed by most Victorian councils. The Local Government Act 1903 (No.1893) removed the requirement that separate committee minutes be kept and introduced the requirement that committees' reports to council be included in the council minutes. In some cases, the minutes of committees are recorded in the council minute books, either in lieu of or in addition to committee reports. Where committee minutes were maintained in separate volumes they constitute a separate series from the council minutes.&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>
