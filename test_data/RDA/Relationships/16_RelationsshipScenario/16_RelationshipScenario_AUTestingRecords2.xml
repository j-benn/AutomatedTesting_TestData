                    My username and password will not be passed on to any other person or organisation.
                    DEC and data custodians reserve the right to revoke registration if the above conditions of access
                    are not complied with.
                    I will notify DEC if any relevant conditions change that might affect my NatureMap authorisation
                    level.
                    Also note:
                    Custodians have kindly granted permission to allow relatively large subsets of data to be downloaded
                    for a wide range of uses, including within a commercial context. Note, however, it is not NatureMap
                    policy to allow the downloading of entire datasets
                    It is current custodian policy to only grant Advanced Access (see the Registration page) for bona
                    fide research or conservation planning purposes. This does not extend to use within a commercial
                    context. While this may appear restrictive, in fact basic registration provides a great deal of
                    information on both conservation and non-conservation taxa, and all users are encouraged to explore
                    NatureMap&amp;#39;s sophisticated querying and mapping capabilities. DEC&amp;#39;s Species and
                    Communities Branch continues to provide information on detailed localities of conservation taxa to
                    consultants and other commercial users on a fee-for-service basis.
                    Fair Use Guidlines
                    As stated above, we want as many people as possible to make use of the data available within
                    NatureMap, so long as that use is &amp;quot;fair&amp;quot;. It is considered fair for anyone to use
                    information from NatureMap for conservation or planning purposes, including incorporating that
                    information into reports or papers, or summarising and value-adding to data.
                    It is not considered fair use to download raw data and on-sell it. That would contravene copyright.
                    It is also bad business, because anyone could obtain the same data directly from NatureMap.
                    Of particular note:
                    Maps, species lists, reports and raw data may be freely used by anyone, including commercial
                    consultants, for research, planning, generating reports and compilations, or for personal use, so
                    long as the above conditions of access are complied with.
                    Raw data, i.e. bulk detail records of individual locations that have been downloaded from NatureMap
                    and not summarised, compiled or modified in any substantial way, may not be on-sold or rebadged
                    without written permission from the Department of Environment and Conservation (DEC). This is
                    consistent with Australian Copyright law.
                    Other descriptive text and images, such as Thematic content on wetlands or ecological attributes,
                    remain the property of NatureMap and copyright holders and may not be used without written
                    permission from DEC.
