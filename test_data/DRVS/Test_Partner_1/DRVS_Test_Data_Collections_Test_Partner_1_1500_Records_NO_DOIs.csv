is to generate similar fine-scale resolution climate projections for the Australian Alps and work with hub
researchers and land managers to apply these unique regional climate projections to the conservation of
biodiversity. Professor Nathan Bindoff leads the Climate Futures team and key contributors are Dr Bec
Harris (Climate Research Fellow), Dr Greg Lee (Climate Modeller) and Paul Fox-Hughes (Bushfire Weather

can be used with multi-model projections of future climate in Tasmania and the Australian Alps. Using the

For example, Arctic sea ice has been thinning dramatically during recent decades, and with it ice age and summer ice extent has reduced. Compared to the Arctic, observations of Antarctic sea ice are few, and while a recent increase in annual maximum sea-ice extent has been observed, little observations exist of its thickness. Satellite-derived information on the state and any variability of the cryosphere system provide an invaluable tool to map the circum-Antarctic system on a regular and sustainable basis. Bringing together a unique suite of dataset, including active/passive microwave, scatterometers, visible, for the region south of 55oS will provide a crucial base for any long-term monitoring and verification of numerical models, as well as for scientific case studies and logistics project. The value of the proposed data holding will be that it is anticipated to be a unique archive of cryosphere-relevant satellite data, as data providers update their own data holdings. For example, the European Space Agency holds its data in a rolling archive, which previously was overwritten every 7 days. In their renewed space programme they aim to hold data for 2 months from their acquisitions. With increasing data capture the data providers will rely more and more on users to quickly access and to safely archive their data.

The Bureau of Meteorology is making a major investment into this new dataset because of the important benefits it offers to Australia. A meteorological ""reanalysis"" takes all available observations and uses a weather model to consistently fill in the fine detail, both at the surface where people live and in the atmosphere as well. Reanalysis datasets are extremely valuable because they provide a consistent method of analysing the atmosphere over a number of years or decades giving greater understanding of the weather over Australia, including extreme events. This greater understanding allows for better planning and management to reduce risks for the future.

The regional reanalysis suite is based on the Australian Community Climate Earth-System Simulator (ACCESS) which is developed in close collaboration between the Bureau, CSIRO and Australian universities. The region covered by the reanalysis, shown below, is the Australian continent, and the surrounding region including parts of southeast Asia, New Zealand, and south to the ice edge of the Antarctic continent.


The reanalysis over the Australian domain is provided with a resolution of approximately 12 km and extends over 70 levels up to 80 km into the atmosphere. For a small number of subdomains, the 12-km reanalysis is downscaled to a 1.5 km resolution.",Tom Remenyi - https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4145-9323,,,,,,,,
