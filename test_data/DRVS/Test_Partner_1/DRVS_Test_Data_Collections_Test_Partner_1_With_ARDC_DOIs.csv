,888,ardc_doi1,040499; 040503;,Example collection 1 with a ARDC owned DOI,"These are in order of generation from radar to oceanographic products not in order of priority for archiving at
Townsville. Item 1 is currently not archived anywhere. Item 3 is likely to be the first priority. 1. Raw HF
radar data i.e. the voltages measured at the receiver from each antenna after mixer processing stages 2.
Range-resolved radar data for each antenna 3. Doppler spectra with or without beam-forming (to resolve
azimuth) depending on the type of radar used. 4. Radial velocities i.e. the component of the surface current
along a direction from the measurement position to the radar. 5. Vector currents obtained by combining data
from two radars. Wave data including significant waveheight, mean and peak period and direction,
directional spectrum and derived wind data.",Brendan Davey - https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1482-7119,,,,,,,,10.4225/14/4F79169D5911B
