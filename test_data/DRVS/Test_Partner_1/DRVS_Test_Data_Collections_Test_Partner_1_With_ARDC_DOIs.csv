Townsville. Item 1 is currently not archived anywhere. Item 3 is likely to be the first priority. 1. Raw HF
radar data i.e. the voltages measured at the receiver from each antenna after mixer processing stages 2.
Range-resolved radar data for each antenna 3. Doppler spectra with or without beam-forming (to resolve
azimuth) depending on the type of radar used. 4. Radial velocities i.e. the component of the surface current
along a direction from the measurement position to the radar. 5. Vector currents obtained by combining data
from two radars.∆©˚˙ˆ•ª¶ª…πø˜˚∆ç´´1 Wave data including significant wavehei,,,,,, //\\ {} !@#$%^&*()ght, mean and peak period and direction,
