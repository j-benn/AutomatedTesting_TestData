3247,LTRAC-ShahramKarami,"The aim of this sub-project is to investigate the physical feedback instability mechanisms of free-/impinging supersonic jet flows in a range of nozzle exit conditions. Supersonic jets occur in engineering applications such as an exhaust of aircraft and rockets, mixing process in supersonic combustors, accidental leakage of pressurized fluid and the new cold spray coating technology. A supersonic jet creates an extremely complicated flow field where a number of complex flow and acoustic mechanisms are interconnected. A considerably important phenomenon is the internalisation of the acoustic waves into shear layer instabilities due to acoustic waves being scattered by the lip of the nozzle. These hydrodynamic instabilities commonly referred to as Kelvin-Helmholtz (K-H) instabilities are growing in the shear layer as they are convected by the flow. Depending on the nozzle pressure ratio and the distance between the nozzle exit and the wall, strong pressure oscillations occur. The instability is intensified when the nozzle exit to wall distance (h/d) is shorter than the potential core. In experimental studies of the under-expanded supersonic impinging jets performed at LTRAC facilities at Monash University, it was observed that the flow behaviour is very sensitive to boundary and initial (inlet) conditions. Therefore, one of the main goals of the proposed research is to perform a comprehensive numerical study of these flows. An in-house high-fidelity LES/DNS code was developed and validated against canonical flows to conduct the simulations. It implements a non-uniform structured finite difference solver with a hybrid spatial scheme employing WENO shock capturing in regions with shock waves and a dispersion-relation preserving scheme in smooth regions of the flow.",https://ror.org/02bfwt286,93026:08:00,105.726,10.26180/5db160fa6a50b,

OzFlux is part of an international network (FluxNet) of over 500 flux stations that is designed to provide continuous, long-term micrometeorological measurements to monitor the state of ecosystems globally.

The OzFlux purpose is:
1. to understand mechanisms controlling exchanges of carbon, water vapour and energy between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere over a range of time and space scales
2. to provide data on carbon and water balances of key ecosystems for model testing
3. to provide information to validate estimates of net primary productivity, evaporation, and energy absorption using remotely sensed radiance data

Australia is the driest inhabited continent on Earth and much of the country has a very low ratio of runoff to precipitation. Its natural ecosystems are globally unique and finely tuned to Australia’s low and highly variable precipitation. Many of its managed landscapes and associated agricultural productivity are dependent on runoff for irrigation. This makes knowledge of the exchange of water between Australian ecosystems and the atmosphere, evaporation, and how this will change as the climate changes, extremely important in managing natural and modified landscapes.

This ability to collaborate over multimodal research data is a powerful tool for the imaging and characterization community.",https://ror.org/02bfwt286,1004:0801:0803:0903:0604:0605:0606:0607,196,10.26180/5f7b2374775af,
1186,RNA Systems Biology Lab,"The Monash University RNA Systems Biology Laboratory group is interested in how both coding and non-coding RNA is expressed and regulated in cells, and how the fine-tuning of this expression, which differentiates health from disease, is maintained. Through their research this group seeks to understand how every RNA in our system is regulated, their experiments often have 100s of millions of data-points and thus require the input of computational biologists.",https://ror.org/02bfwt286,61423:35:42,37.79559,10.26180/5f7f8f8f5df60,
879,Genome-wide mapping of cardiac regulatory elements,"Developmental processes are complex and intricate by nature hence they cannot be deciphered solely by investigating single gene interactions. Cutting-edge genome-wide scale interrogation techniques allow addressing organogenesis at a whole-systems level, and these technologies continue to revolutionize biomedical science. By taking advantage of these novel technologies, the Ramialison laboratory is developing and applying bioinformatics tools to advance our understanding of heart development, disease and evolution. This involves the generation of a unique collection of genome-wide cardiac-specific datasets that will allow to decipher in a systematic manner, the genes and interactions that lead to proper heart formation.","https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6315-4777,https://ror.org/02bfwt286",61125:34:43,20.14005,10.26180/5f800bdb46c09,
3229,Institute of Railway Technology,"The dataset will include the raw data as measured by the instruments attached to the vehicles as well as the processed information derived from the raw data (vehicle dynamic response, track condition reports). The single trip data is used to report on operational issues (e.g. track defects and driving strategies). Aggregated trip data is used to report on and planning for track maintenance as well as the effectiveness of track maintenance. The data collected across the various rail networks in the long term will constitute a body of data that can be mined for information related to vehicle performance and the evolution of track condition under different environments.",https://ror.org/02bfwt286,91399,57.028644,10.4225/03/58ab8cadcf152,
