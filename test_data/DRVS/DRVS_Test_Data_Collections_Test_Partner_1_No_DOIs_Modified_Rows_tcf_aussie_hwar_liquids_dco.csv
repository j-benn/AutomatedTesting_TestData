part of the Climate Futures for Tasmania project (2007-2010). Their role in the Landscapes and Policy Hub
is to generate similar fine-scale resolution climate projections for the Australian Alps and work with hub
researchers and land managers to apply these unique regional climate projections to the conservation of
biodiversity. Professor Nathan Bindoff leads the Climate Futures team and key contributors are Dr Bec
Harris (Climate Research Fellow), Dr Greg Lee (Climate Modeller) and Paul Fox-Hughes (Bushfire Weather
Analyst). In consultation with land managers and hub researchers, they are generating ecological indices that
can be used with multi-model projections of future climate in Tasmania and the Australian Alps. Using the
new climate projections, researchers, planners and managers will have a greater capacity to explore the likely
implications of climate change on priority species, communities and threatening processes. Other contact

,257,gfat,040104; 040602; 040105; 040503;,Cryospheric data from the Antarctic/Southern Ocean,"Recently an increasing rate of change in the Southern Hemisphere's cryospheric components has been observed. For example, Arctic sea ice has been thinning dramatically during recent decades, and with it ice age and summer ice extent has reduced. Compared to the Arctic, observations of Antarctic sea ice are few, and while a recent increase in annual maximum sea-ice extent has been observed, little observations exist of its thickness. Satellite-derived information on the state and any variability of the cryosphere system provide an invaluable tool to map the circum-Antarctic system on a regular and sustainable basis. Bringing together a unique suite of dataset, including active/passive microwave, scatterometers, visible, for the region south of 55oS will provide a crucial base for any long-term monitoring and verification of numerical models, as well as for scientific case studies and logistics project. The value of the proposed data holding will be that it is anticipated to be a unique archive of cryosphere-relevant satellite data, as data providers update their own data holdings. For example, the European Space Agency holds its data in a rolling archive, which previously was overwritten every 7 days. In their renewed space programme they aim to hold data for 2 months from their acquisitions. With increasing data capture the data providers will rely more and more on users to quickly access and to safely archive their data.

Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS), and was extended and enhanced through the
Education Investment Fund (EIF) in 2009, and extended under the Collaborative Research Infrastructure

equipment to monitor the open oceans and coastal marine environment around Australia, covering physical,
chemical and biological variables. All IMOS data is freely and openly available through the IMOS Ocean
Portal for the benefit of Australian marine and climate science as a whole. IMOS observations are guided by
societal needs for improved ocean information, and focused through science planning undertaken
collaboratively across the Australian marine and climate science community. There are are five major
research themes that unify IMOS science plans and related observations: Multi-decadal ocean change;
Climate variability and weather extremes; Major boundary currents and interbasin flows; Continental shelf

the time taken to establish and set up a numerical model simulation for a given spatial and temporal domain.
By stepping through a menu-driven browser a user can choose from a set of five coastal ocean hydrodynamic
and wave models, define the spatial extent (in Australian waters) and desired spatial resolution and the
temporal extent (subject to available dataset span) of a simulation, choose from a set of datasets for the
definition of initial and forcing fields, and request observational data for validation. These assembled
datasets can then be packaged together to be used on a computer of choice. This data collection for MARVL
consists of a) input datasets: several ocean model re-analyses obtained from different sources and used for
initial and lateral boundary conditions, several atmospheric model re-analyses for surface forcing,
bathymetry datasets, observation datasets, and b) output datasets: initially the assembled model bundled
datasets, but, also model simulation output datasets once MARVL is configured to submit jobs to a cloud
environment (planned in 2014).",Brendan Davey - https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1482-7119,,,,,,,,

The Bureau of Meteorology is making a major investment into this new dataset because of the important benefits it offers to Australia. A meteorological ""reanalysis"" takes all available observations and uses a weather model to consistently fill in the fine detail, both at the surface where people live and in the atmosphere as well. Reanalysis datasets are extremely valuable because they provide a consistent method of analysing the atmosphere over a number of years or decades giving greater understanding of the weather over Australia, including extreme events. This greater understanding allows for better planning and management to reduce risks for the future.

The regional reanalysis suite is based on the Australian Community Climate Earth-System Simulator (ACCESS) which is developed in close collaboration between the Bureau, CSIRO and Australian universities. The region covered by the reanalysis, shown below, is the Australian continent, and the surrounding region including parts of southeast Asia, New Zealand, and south to the ice edge of the Antarctic continent.


The reanalysis over the Australian domain is provided with a resolution of approximately 12 km and extends over 70 levels up to 80 km into the atmosphere. For a small number of subdomains, the 12-km reanalysis is downscaled to a 1.5 km resolution.",Tom Remenyi - https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4145-9323,,,,,,,,

habitat to be expanded to large scales (global, and on-going through time) through the participation of
trained volunteer SCUBA divers. The RLS database now contains data from >2,200 sites worldwide, and is
continually growing through time-series information from monitoring activities at numerous locations
around Australia. A core standard component of RLS biodiversity survey methods is collection of imagery of
attached marine life on the seabed (photo-quadrats). The RLS photo-quadrat collection contains
photographic images taken by RLS divers with a digital camera at regular intervals along 50 m transect lines
set at each of these sites. With extensive coverage of the shallow, inshore and offshore reef systems around
Australia to a depth of 42 m (mostly in the range of 1-20 m), it usefully complements other marine imagery
collections such as those from deep water collected by Autonomous Underwater vehicles (AUV). It also
extends to over 40 other countries and all major ocean basins, making it possible to answer many large-scale
research questions (such as looking at biogeographic patterns and gradients with environmental variables.
With most data focused in coastal regions, it is also of great value for research and management foci on
patterns related to human impacts. The collection currently includes >81,000 images, and is continually
growing as new surveys are done by RLS divers.",Rick Stuart-Smith - https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8874-0083,,,,,,,,
